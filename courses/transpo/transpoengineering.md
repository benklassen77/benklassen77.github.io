## Introduction

Transportation - Purpose and objectives:

1. Provide **mobility**: move people and goods at an acceptable level of service
2. Provide **accessibility**: to economic and social activities, which are distributed over space and time. Mobility and accessibility go hand-in-hand
3. Provide **safety**: mitigate traffic fatalities and severe injuries
   - 2000 people killed and 165000 injured using Canada's road transportation system
4. Promote **economic prosperity**: bad transportation hurts the economy, while good transportation boosts the economy
5. Promote **environmental sustainability**: encourage sustainable development of land use and reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions
   - transportation sector contributed 34% to anthropogenic GHG emissions in Ontario in 2012
   - 7 Gt CO2 equivalent of direct GHG emissions in 2010
6. Promote **equity**: essential accomplished by designing transportation system that are fair

Benefits of transportation

- fulfill demand, move people and goods
- emergency and defence benefits

Costs of transportation

- time
- energy, material and land use
- noise
- pollution
- accidents

Balance between benefit and cost

- plan, design, and operate a cost-effective system
- maximize benefits while minimizing costs
