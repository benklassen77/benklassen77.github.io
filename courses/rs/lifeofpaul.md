Discussion response

1. Paul is depicted with a long, shaggy beard wearing a red rope. His posture is typically leaning to a side, suggesting that he is deep in thought. He is never smiling. Paul is also shown either writing a letter, holding a book, or weilding a sword. Occasionally he is praying. 
2. The sword may be symbolic of either Paul's fight against the Old Law and against the sinful world or his oppressive past life. In either case, it could symbolize that Paul is willing to fight for what he believes. It could also symbolize the sufferings Paul endured as a Christian missionary. The beard may be symbolic of Paul's wisdom. As well, the books and prayer may be symbolic of Paul's devotion to the Lord.
3. I personally visualize Paul as looking less well-kept due to his enduring sufferings. I am also surprised that Paul is depicted writing the letters, as I would have expected them to depict him telling a scribe what to say. I would have liked the images to depict an arrogance that I often think Paul possesses when I read his letters.
4. The images of Saint Paul feature a halo around Paul's head, which is not seen in the other images. Aside from that, he looks identical.
5. Art is truly a mirror of society. In first century context, it is likely that many would have seen Paul as either a heretic or a cult-leader. His convictions were opposed to those of religious authorities and to the Jewish faith, which had stood the test of time. In this sense, Paul's sad face and his sword could reflect 1st century views of him being a troublemaker. The beard, halo, letters, and red robe may reflect his later appearance as being one of the most prolific theologians and influencial Christ-follower in history. The beard, halo, and letters depict Paul as being wise, just, and dedicated. This change in depiction is important because interpretation of messages can change throughout time, and having a visual reference to this change can provide context for works from that respective era.

6. I was most interested in the red robe Paul is always wearing. After searching online, I discovered that this symbolized Paul's martyrdom. I had expected it to be symbolic of Christs blood. Thus, it is understandable that it symbolizes Paul's sacrifice for his beliefs
7. I would have liked there to be more of God in these depictions. Giving Paul a halo and a wise demeanor glorify him rather than point to his purpose. The depiction of Paul writing the letters make it appear like human wisdom rather than Father-inspired scripture. A cross in the background of these images would have helped clear this up.
