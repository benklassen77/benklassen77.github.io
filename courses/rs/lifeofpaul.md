# Life of Paul

- [Life of Paul](#life-of-paul)

## Module 1

- Paul has a lot of contraversy. Tom Jefferson called him the first corrupter of the documents of Jesus
- While Jesus was kind and patient, Paul was harsh and a bit of a bully

Discussion response

1. Paul is depicted with a long, shaggy beard wearing a red rope. His posture is typically leaning to a side, suggesting that he is deep in thought. He is never smiling. Paul is also shown either writing a letter, holding a book, or weilding a sword. Occasionally he is praying. 
2. The sword may be symbolic of either Paul's fight against the Old Law and against the sinful world or his oppressive past life. In either case, it could symbolize that Paul is willing to fight for what he believes. It could also symbolize the sufferings Paul endured as a Christian missionary. The beard may be symbolic of Paul's wisdom. As well, the books and prayer may be symbolic of Paul's devotion to the Lord.
3. I personally visualize Paul as looking less well-kept due to his enduring sufferings. I am also surprised that Paul is depicted writing the letters, as I would have expected them to depict him telling a scribe what to say. I would have liked the images to depict an arrogance that I often think Paul possesses when I read his letters.
4. The images of Saint Paul feature a halo around Paul's head, which is not seen in the other images. Aside from that, he looks identical.
5. Art is truly a mirror of society. In first century context, it is likely that many would have seen Paul as either a heretic or a cult-leader. His convictions were opposed to those of religious authorities and to the Jewish faith, which had stood the test of time. In this sense, Paul's sad face and his sword could reflect 1st century views of him being a troublemaker. The beard, halo, letters, and red robe may reflect his later appearance as being one of the most prolific theologians and influencial Christ-follower in history. The beard, halo, and letters depict Paul as being wise, just, and dedicated. This change in depiction is important because interpretation of messages can change throughout time, and having a visual reference to this change can provide context for works from that respective era.
6. 
6. I was most interested in the red robe Paul is always wearing. After searching online, I discovered that this symbolized Paul's martyrdom. I had expected it to be symbolic of Christs blood. Thus, it is understandable that it symbolizes Paul's sacrifice for his beliefs
7. I would have liked there to be more of God in these depictions. Giving Paul a halo and a wise demeanor glorify him rather than point to his purpose. The depiction of Paul writing the letters make it appear like human wisdom rather than Father-inspired scripture. A cross in the background of these images would have helped clear this up.

### Hellenism

Paul's Timeframe

- Paul's life took place under Augustus (Roman Emperor)
- Paul became a follower of Jesus during reign of Tiberius
- Paul wrote his letters during time of emperors Claudius and Nero
- Paul likely died under Nero

Paul's world was Greco-Roman

- Wrote all letters in Greek
- Alexander the Great lived 356-323 BC
	- Conquered land all the way to India, and South to Egypt
	- Aristotle was Alex's tutor, influencing him greatly with Greek culture. He established cities modeled after Greek ideals
		- Had city squares *agora*, colonnades *stoas*, temples, theatres, stadiums etc
		- Lead to widespread of Greek language. *Koine* is street Greek, and was Paul's language
	- Lead to cosmopolitan culture of **Hellenism**, or Greekish culture
- Since *Koine* was used so widespread, Paul was able to communicate with places all over the place due to common language

### Roman Empire

Transportation and Engineering

- invented roads and safe sea-routes in order to enable the movement of troops. Similar to Hitler and Eisenhower
	- Paul travelled along *Via Egnatia*
	- Allowed Paul to avoid storms
- invented arches and bridges to optimize travel time
- invented the dome. Eg. Pantheon

Military Conquests

- Created *Pax Romana* in order to pacify the Mediterranean worls
- Furthered cosmopolitan culture through slavery
	- Greek and Roman civilizations were premised on slavery
	- Wars of conquest created booty and slaves, which were also born to slave women

**Manumission**: the setting free of a slave

- Most slaves freed by 30
	- It was expensive to keep a slave
	- Slaves often stayed part of extended family as freedman
	- One method was to sell the slave to a temple. The person was them freed of the master and slave to the god

### Urban Life

In contrast to Jesus's largely rural world of Galilee, Paul lived in largely centered cities throughout the Eastern Mediterranean world of both urban and cosmopolitan (Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome)

Nature of city life

- agora, theatre, temples
- wealthy had great homes, and most lived in crowded slums
- cities were melting pots of culture
	- districts of similar trades
	- guilds and associations for funerary societies, which offer a model of Paul's congregation

Social Organization

- *Patriarchy* in which the Father at the head, followed by mother, children, freedmen, and then slaves
- *Patron/client relationships* existed. Society was many patron/client relationships, which was headed by the emperor. Patron helped client, who was indebted to the patron
- *Honour/shame* was important in society. Behaviour was motivated by aquiring honour and avoiding embarrassment and shame, or dishonour. Wealthy gained honour by putting on feasts, games, building temples etc.
	- Suggestive of philanthropy, where people might establish institutions and name them after themselves
	- In Corinth, Paul insists that he works with his own hands. Paul suggests that he is a slave of Christ, and that people are to imitate a master who was the ultimate slave. Paul stressed humility, which was radical

### Religion

Olympian gods, as well as gods of conquered land were placed on Roman pantheon

There were also mystery religions, like isis and mithras. In these, people were inducted in secret, and religious rites were performed in secret. This secret relationship seemed to meet the need for secret, intimate relationship with a deity. Similarly, Christianity had rites, like **communion**. However, in contrast with the other religions, Christian practices were to be performed publicly. Outsiders were supposed to be drawn to Christianity rather than pushed away by secretive behaviour.

There was also a healing cult from the god Asclepius. At these temples, healings and worship took place. Plastor casts were made of healed body parts. Healing was also central to Paul and Jesus.

Virtues were also personified as gods. Nike as Victory, Sophia as Wisdom, etc. In 1 Corinthians 1, Jesus was referred to as the wisdom of God. Also known as hypostatisation

**Euhererism**: accounted for gods as being herioc human beings believed to have become gods

- Acts 6, Paul was mistaken as Zeus after healing

Philosophies were also very significant

- in modern times, philosophy is distinguished from theology
- early followers of Paul would have referred to him as a philosopher
- Neo-Pythagoreans were healors and exorcists. Somewhat resemble Paul or Jesus
- Cynics were traveling social critics, who pledged to poverty and seemed rude or upset. They mercilessly criticized society through the *Cynic Diatribe*, which garnered the interest of crowds

Imperial Cult

- the emperor worship was still on the rise in Paul's day
- as Hellenism fused some of Greek culture and oriental culture, monarch deification was transferred to Rome after Julius Caesar was assassinated. Augustus was the first of this.
- They worshipped the god Roma and the emperor
- Some of the words used by the people would have been offensive at the time. Eg. Messiah would have challenged the Roman Imperial Cult directly. Gospel, salvation etc. would have described the emperor and his mission

### Judaism

Paul was a Jew, and a Pharisee to the end. Paul was educated in Jerusalem

In Paul's day, Jews were found throughout the Mediterranean and beyond. Most lived outside Palestine, with Jerusalem and its temple the hub of very diverse religion. Reasons for dispersion/diaspora:

1. Exile
2. Enslavement
3. Commerce
4. Missionary activity? 1 fifth of Hellenistic cities was Jewish

Synagogues found everywhere in Acts. Not only Jews found but also God-worshippers, whom hadn't received circumcision etc.
s

Riots in Rome among Jews over *Chrestus* led to their expulsion by Claudius in 49 AD.

- suggests high prominence and prevalence during Paul's time

Judaism was highly diverse from those quite at home within broader Greco-Roman society to those violent against it

- Jews were exempted from fighting in Roman military
- Jews were allowed to meet and collect money
- Jews were somewhat valued in society
- in 66-70, Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple was never rebuilt
- Before the temple was destroyed, Jerusalem served as a diverse hub of Judaisms
- Some of the Judaisms were tolerable of Rome, others weren't

The Law was one of the biggest dividing points between Paul and the other Jewish leaders. Eg. Torah and circumcision.

- many were drawn to moral values of Torah, drawn to theology and Jewish ethics, monotheism. They were not proselytes, as they didn't undergo circumcision. They were referred to as *God-worshipers*

At the time, Paul was still Jewish

### Apocalyptic Eschatology

**Eschatological or Eschatology** comes from the Greek adjective eschatos, meaning last.

**Apocalypse** means revelation or uncovering

Characteristics of apocalyptic orientation

1. **Dramatic imagery**. Dragons, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11
2. **Dualism**. Battle between light and dark
3. **Revelation**: written in a time of chaos. The woes project that God is sovereign and new suffering would exist and ensue (Romans 13:11-14)
4. Resurrection suggested that it was the turn of the ages, as suggested with the Spirit, the coming of the Messiah, and the new way to live
5. Earth-shattering imagery. Some believe that apocalyptic imagery leads to the end of the universe. A more modern thought is this. God will not allow injustice, oppression, disease, and sin to continue, and God will intervene dramatically through his Messiah. "A new heaven to earth will be brought. As Paul refers to, a 'new creation'. Rather than ending history, it brings history as we know it to a close. It doesn't end the relationship between humanity and God, but rather brings an end to rebellion and alienation. Not the cessation of the ages, but rather the breaking of a new age. Forces that will be shattered will be those of greed, oppression, and violence.
6. Resistance and hope. Paul thought Rome and Satan's days were numbered
