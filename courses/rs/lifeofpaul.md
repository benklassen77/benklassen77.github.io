## Module 1

- Paul has a lot of contraversy. Tom Jefferson called him the first corrupter of the documents of Jesus
- While Jesus was kind and patient, Paul was harsh and a bit of a bully

### Non-Biblical Sources

1. *Kerygmata Petrou*
       - Late 2nd century doc
     - Different than earlier *Kerygma Petrou*
     - Reflects hostility to Paul regarding his antilaw teachings. Referred to Paul as Simon
2. *Correspondence between Paul and Seneca*
     - 3rd or 4th century doc
     - Suggests correspondence between Paul and Seneca, a philosopher of Nero. Places Paul much like Acts 17
3. *Acts of Paul*
      - 2nd century doc
      - Combination of 3 elements
        - Legends of Thecla
        - Martyrdom of Paul
        - 3 Corinthians
      - Reflects how Paul was viewed at the time, especially his attitute to women
4. *Marcion*
      - Marcion rejected Israel scriptures and accepted Paul's letters and edited version of Luke
      - Wrote the antitheses
      - Church chose to keep the other gospels and the other letters aside from those Marcion liked

### New Testament Background

**Canon**: criterion

Bible is a list of authoritative writings recognized as Scripture. The books were put on the list by **canonization**. This was accelerated when Marcion tried to do this himself. Canonization was finished in 367 CE by Bishop Athanasius through the Easter Letter.

Issues facing the early Jesus-movement

1. Resurrection and 2nd coming. Everyone believed that Jesus rose, but the wait for Jesus's return brought confusion
2. Jew-Gentile relations. Relevance of the Torah in Jewish-Gentile communities
3. Roman-Empire. Gospel was counter imperial, the king was considered a messiah

### NT Sources

Logic behind Pauline organization

1. Groups to individuals. Romans -> Thessalonians -> Timothy -> Philemon
2. Large to small Romans -> 2 Thessalonians -> 1 Timothy -> Philemon

Acts

- Acts is selective history. Paul doesn't mention general theology, but rather convictions specific to the times and places of the people
- Travel is strong, and is important in the intrigue of the story
- Leaves a lot out. James and Timothy etc. Retrospective

Letters

- there is an agenda
- not autobiographical
- not systematic theology, but contextual theology

Discussion response

1. Paul is depicted with a long, shaggy beard wearing a red rope. His posture is typically leaning to a side, suggesting that he is deep in thought. He is never smiling. Paul is also shown either writing a letter, holding a book, or weilding a sword. Occasionally he is praying.
2. The sword may be symbolic of either Paul's fight against the Old Law and against the sinful world or his oppressive past life. In either case, it could symbolize that Paul is willing to fight for what he believes. It could also symbolize the sufferings Paul endured as a Christian missionary. The beard may be symbolic of Paul's wisdom. As well, the books and prayer may be symbolic of Paul's devotion to the Lord.
3. I personally visualize Paul as looking less well-kept due to his enduring sufferings. I am also surprised that Paul is depicted writing the letters, as I would have expected them to depict him telling a scribe what to say. I would have liked the images to depict an arrogance that I often think Paul possesses when I read his letters.
4. The images of Saint Paul feature a halo around Paul's head, which is not seen in the other images. Aside from that, he looks identical.
5. Art is truly a mirror of society. In first century context, it is likely that many would have seen Paul as either a heretic or a cult-leader. His convictions were opposed to those of religious authorities and to the Jewish faith, which had stood the test of time. In this sense, Paul's sad face and his sword could reflect 1st century views of him being a troublemaker. The beard, halo, letters, and red robe may reflect his later appearance as being one of the most prolific theologians and influencial Christ-follower in history. The beard, halo, and letters depict Paul as being wise, just, and dedicated. This change in depiction is important because interpretation of messages can change throughout time, and having a visual reference to this change can provide context for works from that respective era.
6. I was most interested in the red robe Paul is always wearing. After searching online, I discovered that this symbolized Paul's martyrdom. I had expected it to be symbolic of Christs blood. Thus, it is understandable that it symbolizes Paul's sacrifice for his beliefs
7. I would have liked there to be more of God in these depictions. Giving Paul a halo and a wise demeanor glorify him rather than point to his purpose. The depiction of Paul writing the letters make it appear like human wisdom rather than Father-inspired scripture. A cross in the background of these images would have helped clear this up.

## Module 2

### Hellenism

Paul's Timeframe

- Paul's life took place under Augustus (Roman Emperor)
- Paul became a follower of Jesus during reign of Tiberius
- Paul wrote his letters during time of emperors Claudius and Nero
- Paul likely died under Nero

Paul's world was Greco-Roman

- Wrote all letters in Greek
- Alexander the Great lived 356-323 BC
  - Conquered land all the way to India, and South to Egypt
  - Aristotle was Alex's tutor, influencing him greatly with Greek culture. He established cities modeled after Greek ideals
    - Had city squares *agora*, colonnades *stoas*, temples, theatres, stadiums etc
    - Lead to widespread of Greek language. *Koine* is street Greek, and was Paul's language
  - Lead to cosmopolitan culture of **Hellenism**, or Greekish culture
- Since *Koine* was used so widespread, Paul was able to communicate with places all over the place due to common language

### Roman Empire

Transportation and Engineering

- invented roads and safe sea-routes in order to enable the movement of troops. Similar to Hitler and Eisenhower
  - Paul travelled along *Via Egnatia*
  - Allowed Paul to avoid storms
- invented arches and bridges to optimize travel time
- invented the dome. Eg. Pantheon

Military Conquests

- Created *Pax Romana* in order to pacify the Mediterranean worls
- Furthered cosmopolitan culture through slavery
  - Greek and Roman civilizations were premised on slavery
  - Wars of conquest created booty and slaves, which were also born to slave women

**Manumission**: the setting free of a slave

- Most slaves freed by 30
  - It was expensive to keep a slave
  - Slaves often stayed part of extended family as freedman
  - One method was to sell the slave to a temple. The person was them freed of the master and slave to the god

### Urban Life

In contrast to Jesus's largely rural world of Galilee, Paul lived in largely centered cities throughout the Eastern Mediterranean world of both urban and cosmopolitan (Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome)

Nature of city life

- agora, theatre, temples
- wealthy had great homes, and most lived in crowded slums
- cities were melting pots of culture
  - districts of similar trades
  - guilds and associations for funerary societies, which offer a model of Paul's congregation

Social Organization

- *Patriarchy* in which the Father at the head, followed by mother, children, freedmen, and then slaves
- *Patron/client relationships* existed. Society was many patron/client relationships, which was headed by the emperor. Patron helped client, who was indebted to the patron
- *Honour/shame* was important in society. Behaviour was motivated by aquiring honour and avoiding embarrassment and shame, or dishonour. Wealthy gained honour by putting on feasts, games, building temples etc.
  - Suggestive of philanthropy, where people might establish institutions and name them after themselves
  - In Corinth, Paul insists that he works with his own hands. Paul suggests that he is a slave of Christ, and that people are to imitate a master who was the ultimate slave. Paul stressed humility, which was radical

### Religion

Olympian gods, as well as gods of conquered land were placed on Roman pantheon

There were also mystery religions, like isis and mithras. In these, people were inducted in secret, and religious rites were performed in secret. This secret relationship seemed to meet the need for secret, intimate relationship with a deity. Similarly, Christianity had rites, like **communion**. However, in contrast with the other religions, Christian practices were to be performed publicly. Outsiders were supposed to be drawn to Christianity rather than pushed away by secretive behaviour.

There was also a healing cult from the god Asclepius. At these temples, healings and worship took place. Plastor casts were made of healed body parts. Healing was also central to Paul and Jesus.

Virtues were also personified as gods. Nike as Victory, Sophia as Wisdom, etc. In 1 Corinthians 1, Jesus was referred to as the wisdom of God. Also known as hypostatisation

**Euhererism**: accounted for gods as being herioc human beings believed to have become gods

- Acts 6, Paul was mistaken as Zeus after healing

Philosophies were also very significant

- in modern times, philosophy is distinguished from theology
- early followers of Paul would have referred to him as a philosopher
- Neo-Pythagoreans were healors and exorcists. Somewhat resemble Paul or Jesus
- Cynics were traveling social critics, who pledged to poverty and seemed rude or upset. They mercilessly criticized society through the *Cynic Diatribe*, which garnered the interest of crowds

Imperial Cult

- the emperor worship was still on the rise in Paul's day
- as Hellenism fused some of Greek culture and oriental culture, monarch deification was transferred to Rome after Julius Caesar was assassinated. Augustus was the first of this.
- They worshipped the god Roma and the emperor
- Some of the words used by the people would have been offensive at the time. Eg. Messiah would have challenged the Roman Imperial Cult directly. Gospel, salvation etc. would have described the emperor and his mission

### Judaism

Paul was a Jew, and a Pharisee to the end. Paul was educated in Jerusalem

In Paul's day, Jews were found throughout the Mediterranean and beyond. Most lived outside Palestine, with Jerusalem and its temple the hub of very diverse religion. Reasons for dispersion/diaspora:

1. Exile
2. Enslavement
3. Commerce
4. Missionary activity? 1 fifth of Hellenistic cities was Jewish

Synagogues found everywhere in Acts. Not only Jews found but also God-worshippers, whom hadn't received circumcision etc.
s

Riots in Rome among Jews over *Chrestus* led to their expulsion by Claudius in 49 AD.

- suggests high prominence and prevalence during Paul's time

Judaism was highly diverse from those quite at home within broader Greco-Roman society to those violent against it

- Jews were exempted from fighting in Roman military
- Jews were allowed to meet and collect money
- Jews were somewhat valued in society
- in 66-70, Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple was never rebuilt
- Before the temple was destroyed, Jerusalem served as a diverse hub of Judaisms
- Some of the Judaisms were tolerable of Rome, others weren't

The Law was one of the biggest dividing points between Paul and the other Jewish leaders. Eg. Torah and circumcision.

- many were drawn to moral values of Torah, drawn to theology and Jewish ethics, monotheism. They were not proselytes, as they didn't undergo circumcision. They were referred to as *God-worshipers*

At the time, Paul was still Jewish

### Apocalyptic Eschatology

**Eschatological or Eschatology** comes from the Greek adjective eschatos, meaning last.

**Apocalypse** means revelation or uncovering

Characteristics of apocalyptic orientation

1. **Dramatic imagery**. Dragons, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11
2. **Dualism**. Battle between light and dark
3. **Revelation**: written in a time of chaos. The woes project that God is sovereign and new suffering would exist and ensue (Romans 13:11-14)
4. Resurrection suggested that it was the turn of the ages, as suggested with the Spirit, the coming of the Messiah, and the new way to live
5. Earth-shattering imagery. Some believe that apocalyptic imagery leads to the end of the universe. A more modern thought is this. God will not allow injustice, oppression, disease, and sin to continue, and God will intervene dramatically through his Messiah. "A new heaven to earth will be brought. As Paul refers to, a 'new creation'. Rather than ending history, it brings history as we know it to a close. It doesn't end the relationship between humanity and God, but rather brings an end to rebellion and alienation. Not the cessation of the ages, but rather the breaking of a new age. Forces that will be shattered will be those of greed, oppression, and violence.
6. Resistance and hope. Paul thought Rome and Satan's days were numbered

## Module 3 - Acts

Acts was written by Luke, a physician mentioned in Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:11, Philemon 24. This Luke also wrote the gospel of Luke. However, both documents were anonymous

Acts 16:10-17, 20:5-15, 21:1-18, 27:1-28:16

- in these sections, the narrative switches from 3rd person to 1st person
- either based on author's own recollection, storytelling device, or another person's recollection

Information of History from Acts

- Paul likely born early CE, and thus quite possibly at the same time as Jesus
- Paul born in Tarsus, a Jew with Roman citizenship
- While in Diaspora, he is trained as a Pharisee in Jerusalem, where his family seems to have relocated, or at least where Acts tells us he had re;atoves
- Later, he participates in the persecution of the followers of Jesus as a "young man"
- His given name was Saul, likely after King Saul, who was from the tribe of Benjamin like Paul. Later his name changes to Paul, which could have been because it was a family name
- Trained as a Pharisee under the great Gamaliel
- He was a zealous persecutor of the followers of Jesus

Paul's big change occured on the damascus road

- traditionally, artists depicted him falling from a horse
- described three ways 9:1-19; 22:6-16; 26:12-18
- Paul was called a Christian at the time. Christian was a nickname, for someone who believed Jesus was the Messiah

### Paul the missionary

1. Starts in Damascus and return to Tarsus
2. Hidden years (mentioned in Galations)
3. Joins Christian community in Antioch, from where the mission to non-Jews seems to take off
   - here, the nickname Christian originated. Christian meant that you
   - early on appears to be Barnabas' companion, not the other way around
4. First Missionary Journey
   - Paul rarely travels alone. Church of Antioch comissioned Barnabas and him to come along too.
   - Acts 13-14
   - healing is the central feature. They are taken to be gods at some times
   - Paul finds synagogues everywhere he goes
     - Paul found ready hearing among proselytes
     - addressed circumcision
5. Second Missionary Journey
   - revisits cells of believers
   - first entry into Europe; first Macedonia (Philippi, Thessalonika), Greece (Athens, Corinth)
   - Notes people of Timothy, Priscilla, Aquilla
   - Paul's speech in Athens 17:16-34 to the philosophical people. Paul shares to people who do not believe in Jesus at all. Paul also tries to find common ground by quoting Greek philosophers
   - Gallio (brother to Seneca) in Corinth, where Paul stayed a long time. In 18:12, Gallio is mentioned. Over those couple years, the only thing mentioned is Gallio
6. Third Missionary Journey
   - Acts 18:23 - 21:14
   - Paul spent 2-3 years in Ephesus
   - site of major letter writing activity of Paul; the Letter to the Ephesians likely not written to Ephesus
   - note the large number of associates of Paul
   - after Ephesus back to Europe and then, finally, to Jerusalem
7. Paul's last visit to Jerusalem
   - Paul visits temple to prove his Jewishness
   - Paul addresses the crowd
   - Paul arrested
   - Paints Jerusalem as negatively as possible and Romans as positive as possible
   - Anger is seen in narratives as Paul is angry that the Jews couldn't accept their own Messiah
   - Paul's letter to the Romans shows that he anticipated a great degree of nervousness
8. Paul's imprisonment
   - Acts 21:15 - 23:22
   - in Caesarea; Paul before Felix, Festus, and Agrippa
9. End
   - Paul likely dies as a martyr in Spain during Nero's persecution

- In acts, Paul is seen as a heroic missionary

### Life as seen in Letters

1. 2 Corinthians 11:21b-33
   - corroborates Acts' depiction of Paul as a suffering survivor
   - from a wounded ego as Corinth was suspicious of him
   - Paul's theology is presented well here
   - weakness/strength presented
2. Philippians 3:2-11
   - *peritome*, or to cut around, was termed for circumcision *katatome*, or to cut against, is a circumcision Pun from Paul
   - reflects both Paul's deep roots in Judaism, and the heat of controversys his approach to non-Jews brought with it. Paul uses harsh language
   - beware of the dogs means cynic philosophers and non-Jews; mutilate means circumcision
   - Cynics used **cynic diatribe** to gain attention from large groups
   - in verse 5, Paul proves how Jewish he is
   - Paul claims to be **zealous**, where he persecutes the Church strongly
   - Paul claimed to be blameless under the Jewish law. This shows that he didn't join the Christian faith because he failed under the law
   - Paul claims all his accomplishment was nothing more than dung
3. 1 Corinthians 9
   - Paul did not accept money for his work
   - Paul did not travel with a spouse
   - Paul says he was a Jew sometimes but willing to give it up in some situations to promote Jesus
   - Corroborates how people had a problem with him, since he claimed to be a Jew but didn't need to follow all the laws.

### Galations 1:1 - 2:14

Tone

- put his credentials at the beginning

Thanksgiving missing

- doesn't give thanks to God, but enters right away into his statement
- curses people

Jerusalem leadership

- refers to the Jerusalem leaders in a derogatory way, including Peter (Cephas), James, and John
- Paul admits to a confrontal relationship with Cephas (Peter)

Paul also confirms to have been an early Christian *zealous* persecutor, Damascus road being the making of a prophet (like Jeremiah) through God revealing his son

- not just conversion to Christianity

In contrast to Acts (Paul working in Jerusalem), Galatians suggests he didn't work in Jerusalem much

- Acts is interested in showing the unification of the church
- Paul demonstrates that he is not dependent on Jerusalem for his gospel

### Paul and The Collection

- Galatians 2:10, Paul talked about remembering the poor
- Acts 11:29-30, Relief being taken by Barnabas and Saul
- 1 Corinthians 16:1-4, Paul was collecting money to send to Jerusalem
- 2 Corinthians 8,9 were separate fundraising letters
- Romans 15:14-32, larger significance of the relief effort
  - Makes reference in verse 16 of Gentiles providing offering through him
  - His collecting funds has delayed his travels to Spain. He wanted to accompany the money so that it would get to Jerusalem, and he wanted to ensure it was accepted by the Jews in Jerusalem
  - if Jews accepted, the body of Messaniac Jews and other Jews could live together

## [1 Thessalonians and Philemon](https://contensis.uwaterloo.ca/sites/courses/1205-Spring-2020/JS-236-RS-236/media/documents/pdfs/module4/Module04-Lecture-Guide.pdf)

Readings:

- 1 Thessalonians
- Acts 17:1-10

### Thessalonica

- a Roman administrative and commercial centre located on the Via Egnatia
- pro-Roman city
- Religiously diverse, with the expected diversity of cults and religions, including the Imperial cult
  - there was a presence of a Samaritan synagogue
  - Cabirus Cult
    - cult legend of a god, killed by his brothers who was expected to return
    - some scholars see feint similarities to Paul's gospel of a dying, rising, and returning deity
    - by Paul's day, the cult had become Romanized, associated w/ orgiastic religious celebrations

### Community of Thessalonians

Make-up of the community

- some Jews, but predominantly Gentile
- mostly artisans and craftsmen, likely working class in poverty
  - Jason was likely wealthy, and could have housed their church
- receptive to Paul
- trouble with sexual holiness
- persecuted for their faith by their own fellow citizens
- suffered because of political opposition to Jesus
- lived w/ eager expectation of Jesus's return. They expected Jesus to come right away

### Paul from Thessalonians

1. Paul works collaboratively w/ others
    - worked w/ Silvanus and Timothy
2. Paul can be very warm and affectionate
    - Importance of giving thanks
    - Yearning to be close to the Thessalonian believers
    - Paul sees himself as their parent (2:7 and 2:11)
3. Paul is committed to integrity
    - while he may seem arrogant, he is only trying to affirm his message w/o the use of rhetoric that was used by cynic philosophers
4. Works with his own hands to support himself financially

### Paul's Message in Thessalonica

Paul taught about Holiness

- 4:1-8, *That each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour*

Second-coming

- 4:15 suggests that the Thessalonians were preparing to be a Welcoming Party to Jesus
- The words 'peace and security' suggested that Rome would be overthrown

Jesus

1. Paul taught them about Jesus as the Messiah, who was crucified and raised
2. Jesus is Lord. Significant because this was the same language that Jews referred to God, and the Romans referred to Caesar
3. Uses phrasing *in Christ*; this means with or through. People are enabled from Jesus

### Paul's letter writing structure

1. Address and Greeting
    - typical Greek greeting at the time was *chairein* (grace), and Jewish greeting was *Shalom* (peace). Paul uses *grace and peace*
2. Thanksgiving
    - often mentions travel plans
3. Body of letter
    - discussion of issues that precipitated the writing of the letter
4. Exhortation *paraenesis*
    - pep-talk that uses the word therefore
5. Eschatological emphasis
    - typically around the end of the *paraenesis*
6. Final greetings and blessings

Paul's apostolic letter is a hybrid between official and personal letters

- refers to everyone else as sister and brother, not as a superior
- style of communication is strongly official, but personal and pushes God as the real boss

### Philemon

Introduction

- co-authored by Timothy
- Philemon is a friend
- addressed to both Philemon and the congregations that gather in his home. Church *ekklesia* meant homes gathered in
- very personal letter
- letters were written to be read aloud, and thus has rhetoric
- invokes slavery dynamics

Context

- Onesimus is Philemon's slave; thus, Christians help slaves
- Onesimus went w/ Paul to Ephesus
- Why did Onesimus go to Paul?
  - maybe a runaway slave; in this case, Paul would need to return him
  - maybe because he was passionate about Paul's teachings, especially the Galatians 3:28 perspective on slavery
  - maybe Philemon did something wrong, and hoped that Paul, being Philemon's friend, would help pardon him
    - Paul was Philemon's spiritual patron
- Paul's prison conditions were not like a dungeon, but shackled to a Roman soldier
  - able to receive visitors, friends, companions, and co-workers with him, and even work for him
  - Onesimus becomes a believer. Paul asks that Philemon treat him as a brother instead of as a slave. Suggests *manumission*
- Because of Paul's strong persuasion, he is seen as both a manipulator and a theologian

### Paul the rhetorician

This letter is deliberative speech

- letter form w/o paraenesis, but blessing still included
- deliberate salutation, exordium, body, peroration, and closing. Starts by affirming the person w/ values, then moves to problem of Onesimus

### Greco-Roman Context of Philemon

Patron/client relationship

- Paul is Philemon's spiritual patron
  - Paul could command him if he chose to do so
  - Paul is old
- Onesimus is like Paul's child, sort of forcing Philemon to treat Onesimus as he would his own patron. Wants Philemon to make a room for Onesimus

The reception of the Letter

- Philemon nervous
- The fact that we have this letter suggests the letter worked
- from Col 4:7-9, it appears Onesimus went on

Slavery

- unquestioned institution in Paul's day. They might have imagined it being abolished during the second coming
- manumission was common
- Paul viewed the community in Christ to be an outpost or colony of the way the world will be when Christ's kingdom will be fully established
- some scholars think it points to the household code of colossians and ephesians

## Galatians

### [Context for galatians](https://contensis.uwaterloo.ca/sites/courses/1205-Spring-2020/JS-236-RS-236/media/documents/pdfs/module5/Module05-Lecture-Guide.pdf)

- Paul is sole author
- Galatians are inhabitants of Roman province Galatia
- province included Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia

To whom was it addressed?

1. South Galatian theory
   - presence of synagogues
   - proximity between Jerusalem and Antioch
   - one of Paul's earliest letters
   - 49-51 CE
2. North Galatian theory
   - Paul's illness
   - Acts 16:6 region of Phrygia and Galatia reference
   - 53-55 CE

Paul refers to those tho unsettle the Galatians

- Agitators promote circumcision while benefiting from the identification of Christ. These would have been ordinary members who were convicted of circumcision, likely due to nearby synagogues. Some refer to these agitators as judaizers. This is a bad term since it is anti-Jew, as well as that Christianity had not been distinguished from Judaism at this point in time.
- Paul had a major confrontation with Peter. Many others who thought differently than Paul came to Galatia and created huge problems
- These people had sown mistrust in Paul

### [Paul's Galatian Argument](https://contensis.uwaterloo.ca/sites/courses/1205-Spring-2020/JS-236-RS-236/media/documents/pdfs/module5/The-Drama-of-Salvation-in-the-Letter-to-the-Galatians.pdf)

Paul was angry

- No thanksgiving or blessing
- Asserts his authority immediately
- Fears Galatians are abandoning him and his *gospel*, or *good news*
- Curses those who preach an alternate gospel

Justification by Faith

- 2:15-16 states "faith in Jesus Christ" to NRSV, this would be in accordance of Faithfulness from Jesus Christ
- Justification does not meann innocence but rather reconciliation and rehabilitation. Grace is where Jesus loved me and gave Himself for me. Grace is to be restored with Christ living in you, so you can live a life in keeping with God's will
- Works of the law could mean death. Effects of the law are death
- Greek word *pistis* could mean faithfulness. For Jews, this meant that to be faithful was to do God's will. Even the demons believe. Faith in God is synonymous to dedication to God's will according to Jews
- thus, views for works of the law, faith/faithfulness, and justification meaning need to be understood

Spirit

- *pneuma* in Greek can be translated to spirit, wind, or breath
- challenges whether they received the Spirit from the law or from the message of the gospel
- Jeremiah 31:31-34. Paul views the Spirit as the way God inscribes the law on people's hearts
- the fruits of the Spirit are right living, as given by the Spirit. In receiving the spirit, they internalize the law. The sum of the law is to love your neighbour
- Thus, Paul is not opposed to the law, but is telling them that the Spirit provides the law. Thus, this will fulfill the law of Christ

[Place of the law in view of the coming of Christ](https://contensis.uwaterloo.ca/sites/courses/1205-Spring-2020/JS-236-RS-236/media/documents/pdfs/module5/The-Drama-of-Salvation-in-the-Letter-to-the-Galatians.pdf)

1. Abraham
   - faith reckoned as righteousness
   - recipient of promise to all nations
2. Law was given later than this promise which could not be annulled by it
   - giving of the law is second to the promise given to Abraham, as Abraham's promise is more foundational
3. Law given because of transgression until the seed (Abraham's seed Genesis 12:7) would come
4. Torah came through a mediator
5. Torah not opposed to the promise of God, but its place in the drama has been replaced by the fulfillment of the promise, the coming of the seed, Jesus the Messiah
6. The coming of faithfulness/faith (Jesus) took the place of the law
7. Law as *paidagogos* (literally someone who leads a child). In other words, the law lead people to the Messiah, to accompany us to the point in the drama when Christ/faith[fullness]/Spirit would come to move the drama of salvation to a whole new level
8. Hagar = law, Sarah = Christ

Christ represents a new reality in which believers participate

- 3:26-28 *in Christ* means that old distinctions no longer hold; to be in Christ is to partake now already of what will become a full reality soon
- minors, even if heirs, are like slaves. 4:4-7 says that they were once slaves, but they are now sons and daughters. They can make their own choices without being told what to do by their slavemaster the law

Christ sets free for life empowered by the Spirit

- 5:1 set free for freedom
- *Adult* freedom of wanting to care for others, to respond to those in need, to say no to the flesh, and to say no to self-indulgence

Conclusion

- to insist on circumcision for Gentiles is thus, in Paul's view, to misread what God is up to at this point in the unfolding drama of salvation. They already have the Spirit, so why should they obey the written rules of circumcision
- the rhetoric and sharpness of argument in this letter has played a significant role in stoking hostility between Christianity and Judaism. Galatians is better read as written by a Jew who believes himself to have been given a divine message for Gentiles at the end of the old age and the dawning of the new.
- Not Christianity vs. the law, but instead is from a time where God saved those who did not follow the law

## 1st Corinthians

### Corinthians Context

- not the first letter to the corinthians
- Corinth is located on land bridge between Peloponnesian peninsula and Greek main land with 2 harbours, Lechaion on the Corinthian Gulf and Cenchreae on the Saronic Gulf
- Destroyed by Romans in 146 BCE, rebuilt by Julius Caesar a century later
- Paul came to Corinth after Athens during time of Claudius in Rome and Gallio's governance
- Written in Ephesus to Sosthenes

Written in Response to the following:

1. Factions and divisions
   - congregation divided into house churches led by patrons
   - multiple missionaries. Might have being seen as **mystagogue**, or leaders into the mysteries
   - **gnostic** used as one who possesses knowledge
   - **sarkikoi** refers to the fleshly ones, or psychic
   - **psychikos** refers to one or something that is natural
   - **pneumatikoi** means spiritual ones. Later used for spiritual gifts
   - **teleioi** used to refer to some as perfect ones
   - thus, people put themselves in a spiritual hierarchy
2. Gender differences
   - Paul talked about problems not so much as praying, but more so dress
3. Status
   - Everyone is part of the body
   - The communion is for everyone
4. Arrogance
   - the big issue
   - they think that their spirituality is so strong that they can do anything with their body, and that they are entitled to do so. This meant incest, legal proceedings, prostitution, and other things that gave them moral-spiritual arrogance
5. Criticize Paul because they are embarrassed
   - Paul isn't married
   - Paul doesn't accept remuneration
6. Questions that were raised by the Corinthians
   - Sex? Divorce? Slave freedom? Resurrection? Collection?

### Paul's Response to the Corinthians

1. The Cross
   - the cross represents God's wisdom, a wisdom which looks foolish to human beings, whether they are Gentile or Jewish
   - Cruxification was scandalous humiliation; state terrorism
   - A crucified liberator was an oxymoron
   - To hold it up as a model undercuts the honour system
   - It is subversive wisdom
2. Paul puts down the Corinthian view of possessing wisdom and knowledge
   - Reminds them that they aren't impressive, and that Paul is Christ's 'fool'
3. Greco-Roman honour/shame, strength/weakness view turned on their head with respect to Jesus Christ
   - Paul tells them to imitate Christ to become 'weak'
4. Christ uses the image of 'the body'
   - *body* was a widely used and understood metaphor in Paul's day. Applied to cosmos
   - often reinforced hierarchial understandings of social organizations. Paul turns this from superiority to equality amongst believers
   - Paul implies that the body is an embodiment of the Messiah; an incarnational aspect of the Christian community. Physical bodies are the temple of God's Spirit
   - **pneumatikoi**, or spirituality and spiritual gifts. **Charismata**, or gifts, suggests that the spirit gives the body gifts for the common good. 2 Christian responses: my gift isn't as important as another. To this, everyone is essential to the community. The other response: arrogance. To this, Paul states that the hand is equal to the eye etc. Thus, it addresses inferiority and superiority complexes
5. Importance of love
   - all good-things, if not motivated by patient and selfless love *agape*, destroy a community through elitism and arrogance
6. Building up the body
   - worship is to serve the upbuilding and the public witness of the community; hence the insistence on making sense in a way that 'builds up' whether in prophecy (speaking divine truth to the community) or in *glossalalia* (speaking in tongues)
   - states that the body should function properly in public. Tongues not meant for self-indulgence, but to build up the church. This is also what is aluded to when discussing female head-coverings, as they should dress to glorify the Church and not themselves. As well, he doesn't want people to seek these gifts for the wrong reasons

### Specific Answers to the Corinthians

1. Marriage
   - deeper form of spirituality found in **celibacy**, or to devote oneself entirely to the Faith
   - divorce is not to be the believer's initiative, but for the sake of *peace* one should allow the unbeliever to divorce
   - **days are numbered** is essential. Freedom is fine for a slave, but not the priority, and marriage is not essential, as the time is near
2. Resurrection and eschatology
   - some Corinthians thought that they had already been resurrected and have already undergone transformation. Thus, they misunderstood it. Basis of spiritual arrogance and moral indifference
   - Paul insists as the resurrection of the body as not an abandonment of the body, but rather a radical renewal of it
   - transformation has begun, but the great resurrection of all and the transformation of the cosmos has not yet happened
   - The new body is both continuous and discontinuous with the present body (seed metaphor). Thus, ethical challenges are thus real for those who still live in this 'old' body
3. Proper order and behaviour in worship
   - Paul wants to bring order to new age worship
   - Women hair covering was an issue. Interpreted as hierarchal, this would be thought of as a way to distinguish between the man and the woman. However, in 11:11, Paul unweaves any hierarchy. Paul does not shut up women, as he knew that they were prophecying and praising with devotion to the Lord. However, he is trying to induce order after some unfortunate event.
4. Lord's supper
   - social hierarchies were adhered to during the Lord's supper. Unity was not expressed
   - Paul tells them that they need to eat together
   - Adds significance because every time they eat and drink the bread and wine (11:23), they are proclaiming the death of Christ. Because they didn't discern the body, they were drinking judgement on themselves.
   - "discern the body" means to recognize who they truly are as part of the Messiah's body

## 2nd Corinthians

Context

- emerged because Paul was not highly revered
- letters were not originally accepted as scripture. Thus, his letters were not always valued
- no evidence of this letter being known outside Corinth until 2nd century (1 Clement)
- Co-authored by Timothy
- Thanksgiving replaced by a eulogy of blessing from God
- starts warm, but gradually becomes more defensive and combative. It's an anomoly that it starts warm and ends hostile. Many scholars think it is a stitching together of several letters

Paul's correspondence (organized by letter number):

1. Letter from 1 Cor 5:9
2. 1 Corinthians
3. 2 Cor 2:14-6:13, 7:2-4
4. 2 Cor 10-13 letter of tears
5. 2 Cor 1:1 - 2:13, 7:5-16
6. 2 Cor 8 fundraising letter to Corinth
7. 2 Cor 9 fundraising letter to Achaia

### Letter 3

- constitudes of Paul's defence of his apostleship in response to the criticisms of the Corinthian believers
- Paul suffers from comparison with other traveling apostles, perhaps from Jerusalem
- Paul is not as good a speaker as he is a writer
- Paul does not have recommendation from Jerusalem
- Paul is seen as weak because he works with his hands

Paul's Response

1. Paul places himself in the victory procession of the Messiah; he calls his competition *peddlers*
2. Turns tables on the Corinthians, by calling them his letter of recommendation
3. States that everyone is a letter written by Christ. Reference to Jeremiah 31:31-34
4. Paul states that the apostle isn't important, but the Messiah and the community he is inscribing
5. Contrasts the New Testament with Moses' Old Testament with allusion to Exodus 34
6. Paul takes the whole community into the tent of revelation with him, where everyone can behold the glory of God as they are transformed by the Lord Spirit
7. Paul is Christ's scribe and the Corinthians' slave. This is trying to put him in perspective
8. Paul's humility as a slave does not diminish, but rather illuminate the glory of the work of Christ
9. Paul states that everything we do is for Christ. All for the emergence of the New Creation, not for a human life. *If anyone is for Christ, Creation is New*

### Letter 4

Circumstances of this part

- Paul had made a painful visit
- Corinthians are comparing Paul with super-apostles
- More of a rhetorical or theatrical effort than an epistolary one

Paul's *Fool Speech*

- Paul is a matchmaker
- Paul is a jilted lover
- Remuneration is an issue
- Paul boasts in his resume
- Power made perfect in weakness. Paul boasts in his weakness
- Paul's last ditch appeal for love

### Letter 5

- Paul is looking back on his letter of tears
- He can now talk about gratitude again
- His letter produced grief in the Corinthians which lead to reconciliation between Paul and the Corinthians

### Letters 6 and 7

Chapter 8

- Paul makes reference to the grace of God, and wants the Corinthians to emulate this
- *grace* translates to charis, which also means *gift*. Translators can't do this justice
- Paul reminds the Corinthians that they are the beneficiaries of God's grace and that they owe that beneficence to others
- The self-impoverishment of Jesus becomes a model for fiscal generosity
- There is an issue of trust in gathering and delivering the money
- Paul intends this delegation to signify to the Jewish believers in Jerusalem the full significance of this gift
- Paul thus commends those who are carrying the money

Chapter 9

- appears to be written w/o the previous chapter
- Paul wants the Corinthians and all in Achaia to live up to his boasting about them
- Paul outlines **divine economy**. God gives gifts for good work -> beneficiaries then perform sharing with those in need -> recipients then give thanks to God
- Paul ends this brief letter with a doxology, with the praise of God for God's gift.

## Philippians

### Content from Acts 16

- Philippi is located on the Via Egnatia
- Roman colony
- 42 BC was a battle between Octavian (later Augustus) and Antony against Brutus and Cassius, the assassins of Julius Caesar
- Lydia, a *god worshipper* lives in Thyatira in Lydia (Asia) who sold purple dyes
- A slave girl carried a pythonic spirit. This is a reference to the mythic role of the python associated with Apollo
- Paul's improsinment and release, as well as the baptizing of the jailor and his household
- Paul escorted out of town given that he is a Roman citizen
- Acts gives hint that congregation is being born

Context

- Authored by Paul and Timothy
- Addressed to the Philippians and to the bishops and deacons
- Possibly written from prison, Caesarea, Ephesus, or Rome
- Written to *Episkopos*: bishop or overseer; and *Diakonos*: deacon or minister
- Tone of letter: warm and appreciative of the Philippians partnership or communion, and also of his competitors
- mention of Epaphroditus, the bearer of the letter and the carrier of the Philippians gift to Paul. Possibly same person as Epaphras in Philemon 23

Composition: likely several letter fragments

1. 1:1-3:1 Fragment 1. Warm acknowledgement of suppoer
2. 3:2-4:1 Fragment 2. Paul's harsh rhetorical distancing of his present life from his former life from his former life as a zealous Pharisee
3. 4:2-9 Fragment 3. Dealing with conflict among leaders (especially Euodia and Syntyche, two important women). These women worked with Clement
4. 4:10-23 Fragment 4. Receipt for Philippians partnership gift

### Philippian Hymn

Context of hymn (Philippians 2:6-11)

1. 2:1-5 could possibly be directed to Euodia and Syntyche. Do nothing out of selfish ambition. Christ is a model for humility and challenge to imperial arrogance. *Jesus emptied himself in human form to death* shows how Jesus humbled himself
2. The hymn is Philippians 2:6-11. There are others:
   - John 1
   - Colossians 1:15-20
   - Hymns that draw on wisdom. Proverbs 8-9, Ecclesiastes, Job, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus. Creation and law is the work of divine wisdom. Personification of wisdom is named *Sophia*. Paul commonly referred to Jesus as wisdom, such as in 1 Cor 1:22-25. Is it *Sophialogy* or *Christology*?. As well, Christ is referred to as the righteous or just One

ACTUAL HYMN

- 2 ways to be read. Wisdom as God? Or Jesus as the true human from Genesis 1:26
  - form of God
  - *grasp* or *exploit* equality with God
  - Jesus as *New Adam* does not grasp at equality with God, but is granted it as a reward
  - Jesus as God's Wisdom/Sophia, whose does not exploit his status as divine but empties himself of it
  - Jesus empties himself to the point of being slave-like to Crucifiction
  - *kenotic* Christology talks about how Jesus empties himself
- Exaltation to the status of deity (The name above every name)
- Hymn is cradle of Trinitarian understanding
- Jesus emptying himself is an example for all

## Romans

Context

- Paul's own letter addressed yo Rome
- Recall the expulsion of Jews from Rome by Claidius because of rioting over *Chrestus*
- Numerous house churches here

Reason for writing the letter

1. Paul intends to go to Spain (15:24) and needs their support, much as he has relied on the Philippians for his missio to Corinth
2. Paul wants to explain his theology to the Romans. Explains law, circumcision, Abraham, and faith with less of an edge
3. Paul needs prayerful support for his accompanying of the money from Gentile believers to the Jewish believers in Jerusalem
   - Paul nervous that they won't accept the money
   - If they accept the money, they are basically approving of his message

Overview

- Romans is the first in the NT order of Paul's letters because it is the largest, not the earliest
- typical letter structure. Address -> Thanksgiving/Explanation -> Body -> Paraenesis -> closing remarks -> Appendix
- Paraenesis emphasizes God's mercies
- Chapter 16 is a note of commendation for a leader of the church at Cenchreae, Phoebe, and a richly informative set of greetings to house-circles. Romans references Prisca, Aquila, Andronicas, Junia, Tryphaena. Written by Tertius. It is possible that Romans 16 was not originally part of Romans but an appendice later on

### Paul's Gospel

1. Justice of God. Basic theme (1:16,17): the justice of God, the power to liberate (or save) those who believe, "The Jew and also the Greek (Gentile)"
   - humans subjected to God's wrath (1:18-3:20). All humans fall short of God's glory, both Jews and Gentiles
   - statement of God's justice apart from the law through Jesus (3:21-16)
   - Abraham the father of both the circumcised and the uncircumcised
   - God is peacemaker and lover of enemies
   - God's justice enables reconcilliation. While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us. Reconcilliation is God's initiative, not human initiative
   - God's grace must not be trivialized by being taken for granted
     - Baptism is dying with Christ to the old way of living, being buried with him, and emerging to a new way of living, in effect living in light of Christ's past resurrection and coming resurrection
     - Freedom from sin is to be enslaved to righteousness or justice
2. Law and Spirit
   - not autobiographical as decicting the human condition generally in light of the law
   - Christ solution to predicament
   - God solved the problem of condemnation through Christ and the Spirit
   - "Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" vs "Law of sin and death" for the purpose of fulfilling the just requirements of the law
   - Spirit is law inscribed onto the heart
   - Paul's realism about this world indicates the need for the assistance of God's Spirit
3. God's faithfulness vis-a-vis the Jews (Romans 9-11)
   - Paul had negative experience of Jewish resistance to his gospel
   - Paul describes his conviction of God's sovereignty
     - God can even use resistance and rebellion to bring about reconciliation
     - God has bound everyone over to disobedience (Romans 11:32)
     - Paul concludes the argument by showing that God's sovereignty is inextricably tied to God's mercy on all
     - Paul is left with nothing but worship in the light of this sketch of God's ways
4. Paraenesis or Exhortation
   - Paul's assumptions behind the paranesis
     - Believers have become slaves to justice
     - Salvation is God intervening to make persons capable of doing God's will
     - God thus pours his love into the hearts of believers
     - Paraenesis thus is premised upon God's mercies

### Romans 3:21 Pivital Passage

1. Paul makes the argument as a Jew. Justice of God "apart from" or "alongside" the Law. This does not mean in opposition, but in addition to or separate from the law
2. The faithfullness of Jesus Christ as God's mean of reconciliation
   - faith in Jesus Christ, or faithfullness of Jesus Christ. Initiative of God that comes to expression through the faithfullness of Jesus Christ that saves. Not just belief in Christ.
3. The faithfulness of Jesus is the gift that brings atonement. Mercy seat. Jesus is God's offering to make peace with humanity. God is just

### Romans 12

1. Paraenesis is premised on the mercies of God
   - "Mercies of God" are the "faithfulness of Jesus Christ"
2. Paul appeals for nonconformity and transformation of life in the body as an act of grateful worship
   - Present your your bodies as a living sacrifice
   - The only worship that makes sense
   - Non-conformity and transformation are the expression of such sacrificial sensible worship
3. Grab bag of motivational exhortations. Trying to fire the people up.
   - members of the same body
   - diversity of gifts
   - hilarious mercy
4. Passionate and peacable language
   - make the needs of the saints your own
   - instead of "practice hospitality", "pursue" strangers with love
   - bless those who persecute you
   - deep solidarity with those who suffer
   - dealing with animosity: being victorious over evil by means of good

### Romans 13:1-7 Subordination

1. The traditional interpretation and role of this text has led to often blind obedience of Christians to the demands of the state, no matter how brutal and unjust
   - Paul is saying: leave vengence to God. Overcome evil with good. There are state authorities that can deal with it. Eg. school kid bullied, principal's office exists
2. In Romans 13:8-14, nonconformity is taught. This suggests that we should not conform to our culture. Christians need to put on weapons of light. Christians need to be careful to not allow verses 1-7 undermine Paul's message

### Radical Hospitality in imitation of Christ

1. Jews observed purity laws, food observance, and Sabbath observance
2. *Strong and weak*: 1 option is that Jews are weak (stuck in Jewish ways) and Gentiles are strong. 2nd option: people who come to a new understanding of Christ such that they can transcend Jewish sensitivities in the presence of Gentiles
3. Being convinced in your own mind. Importance of being convinced of one's actions
4. Freedom for the sake of others. The strong are to bear with the failings of the weak, as did Christ. And the weak are not to bind the strong
   - 15:7, treat each other as God in Christ has treated you
5. What exactly does Paul advise? He doesn't say, but is clear that the Roman believers are to be Christ to each other

## Paul and our Time

1. Homosexuality
   - Paul shared with fellow Jews of his day an abhorrence of homosexual activity, widely prevalent in Greco-Roman society
   - Was what Paul objected to the same thing as committed same-sex relationships in our day?
     - What Paul knew of homosexuality was pederasty. Sexual exploitation was bad then, and is illegal now.
2. The place and role of women
   - Many texts reflect women as active or co-workers. Phoebe, Junia, Chloe, Prisca/Priscilla, Euodia, Syntyche. Also women actively praying and prophysying in Corinth. View of Galatians 3:28 where "in Christ there is not Jew or Greek, slave nor free, male and female"
   - Texts support subservience of household codes, which might reflect later realities than those of Paul's own day (Col 3:18-4:1, Eph 5:22-6:9). Possibly hierarchial standards from the time
   - (1 Cor 14:33b-36, 1 Tim 2:11-12) call women to be quiet. 1 Tim may reflect an increasingly conservative view of Paul's teaching over against an increasingly radical view of Paul's theology and ethics. How do we make sense of 1 Cor 14:33-36, especially since Paul recognizes in 1 Cor 11 that women are actively praying and prophesying
     - Interpolation (perhaps not originally part of the letter)
     - Paul is addressing married women, suggesting their behaviour not cause offence
     - Paul is quiting those in Corinth who wish to silence women, only to take issue with them
   - What to do with mixed signals?

## Letters that Paul might not have written

**Pseudepigraphy**: attributing a piece of writing to an author who didn't actually write it

- does this raise questions about the integrity of the scriptures? No

Reasons for writing in Paul's name:

1. To show respect for Paul's mission and views
2. To show dependence on the revelatory tradition of Paul as an apostle or messenger of God (eg. guarding the deposit in Timothy). There could be a distinction betwen the writer and the author
3. To correct perceived misinterpretations of the apostle's legacy
4. To garner support for a particular interpretation of Paul's teaching during a time of controversy. Eg. 2 Thessalonians and Marcion

Was anybody fooled?

- 2 Thessalonians 2:20

Why is there suspicion?

1. Style of writing. In pastoral letters, there are many terms that didn't show up before
2. Theology. Ephesians and Colossians have different eschatology. It is more past tense than future tenses found in other letters
3. Sociology. In 1 Timothy, there is reference to a bishop. This suggests future structure. In 1 Corinthians 7 and 12, he wishes people to be celibate and to accept spiritual gifts.

### 2 Thessalonians

Supposedly written by Sylvanius, Paul, Timothy

A change in eschatology

- the way of talking about and anticipating Christ's *parousia* is quite different from 1 Thessalonians. Chapters 1 and 2 state that the *parousia* is not coming at any moment

Reasons given for Christ's delay in returning/differences

1. 2:3 states the rebellion and lawless one must come first
2. 1:7-8 states Jesus will come as avenging judge
3. Very harsh words directed to people who think the day of the Lord has already come
4. Paul is strongly identified with a futuristic eschatology

Reasons for impersonation suspicion

- 2:5 when I was still with you. Possibly author slipped that Paul is from the past
- provides a scehario in which the "delay" makes sense. Paul's entire gospel assumes the Lord is coming soon. This contradicts Paul's wording of "don't worry about getting married"
- mimics 1 Thessalonians for wording

### Colossians

Background

- no information from Acts, no evidence that Paul had visited or worked in Colossae
- connections to letter to Philemon (references Epaphras, Luke, Aristarchur, Onesimus)
- connection to nearby Laodicea
- ostensible co-author is Timothy

Reasons for doubt that Paul was the author

1. Style: grammar, syntax, terminology
2. Theology
   - Christology: Christ is the cosmic lord, modeled after personified wisdom
   - Eschatology: Instead of Christ coming in the future, here eschatology is turned vertical. *Has* delivered us. 2:15
3. Sociology
   - request to have letters shared among congregations
   - from cells or house-churches to the universal church (similar to ephesians)
   - 3:18-4:1 "household code"
   - undisputed letters often reference money. Disputed letters never reference money.
   - city of Colossae was destroyed in an earthquake in 60 CE. Request that the letter also be read in Laodicea

It was written because of a problematic *philosophy*: a piety marked by asceticism and angelic worship, with a focus on elements or elemental spirits, resulting in fear-driven religion

### Paul's response to the Colossians

1. Response to piety towards elemental powers
   - Christ is cosmic lord
     - Christ has disarmed the powers
     - the eternal life of believvers is already hidden with Christ above, since believers have already been raised with Christ
   - Identification with Christ in baptism means that believers identify now already with his resurrection and exaltation, even as they await his and their own revelation. Readers do not need to be afraid, as Christ has defeated powers
   - Both worship and ethics are to be informed by the cosmic lordship of Jesus Christ
2. Christological hymn 1:15-20
   - Christ the *icon* of God
   - *First-born* of all creation
   - Agent and goal of creation
   - Head of the body, the church
   - First-born from the dead
   - Fullness of God dwells in him bodily
   - Christ the peacemaker and reconciler through his own execution by crucifixion
   - Informing the hymn is the figure of Wisdom from the Jewish wisdom tradition, jast as in the case of the hymn in Philemon 2:6-11

Baptism: ritual of baptism is *taking off* and *putting on* the new human. Christ is new, Adam is old

### Household Code

- originaled from German *Haustafel*
- reflects basic structure of the Greco-Roman household
- origins of the household code:
  - aristotle
  - stoic lists of duties via the Jewish synagogue?
  - Jesus' own teaching about putting others first?
- other instances of the code
  - Ephesians 5:21-6:9
  - 1 Peter 2:13-3:7
  - 1 Tim 2; Titus 2:2-10
- appearance of the household code in the NT may be a sign that at least a good part of the movement was becoming more *conservative* by adapting to the pravailing patriarchal structures and conventions. Putting children, slaves, and women in their place so that the movement becomes more "respectable" at the time

Countercultural element may nevertheless be present

- persons lower in status are addressed directly as moral agents, and are addressed first in each pairing, but subordination is not reciprocal, however much the attitudes of the superiors is to be marked by love and respect. This may have been seen as quite radical in social implication at that time

Conclusion to Colossians

- Life “in Christ” is lived out in the here and now; they are to “seek the things that are above,” but to do so very much down below in the everyday relationships of life in community

## Ephesians

### Context of Ephesians

- highly valued in the Christian tradition as a distillation of Paul's theology, and as a basis for Christian unity among the diverse traditions

Reasons for questioning Paul's authorship

1. Use of 1/3 of Colossians
2. Style: long sentences, multiple nouns, and adjectives for the same point. No punctuation
3. Organization of the letter as a whole
   - 2 equal halves
   - an act of worship opens the letter at 1:3 with a blessing of God
   - thanksgiving and prayer, beginning at 1:15, which is picked up agian and concluded at 3:14-19
   - first half concludes in the way it began, with a doxology. Seems like its from a liturgy
   - second half represents the paraenesis
4. Theology
   - Church (ecclesiology) takes precedence over Christology, or better Christ is viewed as present in his 'body'
   - Eschatology focuses on what is presently already the case, even though the future 'hope' does not disappear
   - wants to explore what is presently true for the church if in fact Christ is its head

Reasons given for why Paul could have written the letter

- Prison (mentioned throughout the letter)
- Written late in Paul's life when he could have spent time reflection on his experiences

Was Paul perhaps not the author?

- did it emerge together with Colossians out of a Pauline "school"
- was it written as a summary of Paul's thought, intended to accompany an early collection of his letters
- was it an *encyclical* or circular letter?
- *In Ephesus* in 1:1 is missing in the usually most reliable manuscripts

### Overview of 1st half of Ephesians

- organized 'chiastically' (chiasm comes from Greek letter "chi", written like an 'X')
- centre of this first half is 2:11-22, which is also chiastically organized, so that at the centre is a hymn to Christ "our peace"
  - Christ represents peace between Jews and Gentiles. Text is written from perspective of a Jew, addressing a Gentile "you"
  - Hymn Christ represents peace between humanity and God. Both Jews and Gentiles. Cross is a crossing of two paths, with Christ in the middle
- the hymn contains destructive imagery to make the point about Christ being "peace"
  - Torah as means of distinction and separation is destroyed by Christ, who has broken down the wall of separation.
    - wall in the temple in Jerusalem separating off the "court of the Gentiles"
    - the wall of Torah in its function instilling a sense of separation
    - not celebration of abolishment of the law, but on separation of Jews and Gentiles through the law
  - Cross as means of "murdering enmity" (2:16)
    - similar use of imagery in 4:8, where Psalm 68:18 is quoted in a way that has many translators rendering it as "taking captivity captive"
- the hymn to Christ who is "our peace" (2:14-16) contains also constructive imagery
  - Christ creates in himself the "new human" out of divided and mutually hostile humanity

### Overview of 2nd half of Ephesians (4-6)

- not chiastically organized, but paraenesis taking up some basic issues preoccupying churches generally in the sphere of the Pauline mission. Not easily identifiable issues addressed.. the issues it does raise are relevant to a larger circle of churches or communities

1. The paraenesis begins with a reminder of the tension inherent in Paul's view of Christ himself, and how believers are to behave: they are to exercise their high calling by walking like servants of each other
   - word play on Paul being one in chains and believers needing to be chained to each other in peace
   - 7 links in the chain of peace
2. Christ gives gift to the body for its growth and for the ministry of all
   - **Gift** refers to people who exercise the various minsitries of proclamation and teaching, so that "the saints" (all believers) can do ministry
3. Baptismal ritual used to urge a new way of living ('walking')
   - the author refers to taking off of "old human" and putting on "new human". Similar to Old vs New Adam
   - reflects baptismal practice
   - taking off "the lie" and "speak truth"
   - prohibitions as foil for positive commands. Prohibitions against stealing, insulting, and nursing anger are a contrast for the more important positive urging of generosity, speaking grace, and being kind and forgiving in imitation of God and of Christ
4. Sharp dualism between good and evil, light and darkness
   - instead of simply turning the back to "fruitless works of darkness" they should be "exposed"
   - exposing darkness to light transforms it into light
   - early baptismal hymn fragment. "awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead"

### Ephesians Household Code (5:21-6:9)

- Christ the self-giving one is model for how social superiors are to behave toward those who are weaker or subordinate to them. Christ's love for the church is a model for husband's love for his wife
- Household Code is grammatically dependent on 5:18, as people are to be "filled with the spirit"
- Mutual subordination should be viewed as a participle grammatically dependent on the imperative to be empowered with the Spirit
- wives are to be subordinate to there husbands who are to love them to the point of offering up their own lives. Children are to obey parents who teach them the way of Jesus. Slaves are to offer their service to masters who are to learn how to put the needs of the slaves before their own. Would men line up for subordination if they knew that that would mean giving up their own lives for the purpose of liberation?

### Armour of God

- Paul recasts the warrior by having the community put on the full armour of God. Waist girded with truth, breastplate with justice, feet with peace, shield of faith, helmet of salvation or liberation, Spirit of God, injunction to pray at all times. Isaiah 59, there is nobody fighting, so God puts on the garments
- Paul places the community of believers into the role of the divine warrior and thus in some ways reverses the tradition from Isaiah 59
- the principalities and powers encompass both spiritual and political dimensions
  - powers wirring around in the air
- the imitation of God extends to the struggle against evil
- the armour is not worn by the individual but by the comunity of believers, by the "body of Christ"
- letter is not defensive, but offensive
- letter closes with a final blessing

## Pastoral Letters: 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus

- named pastoral because they are addressed from Paul to specific pastors of churches
- nature of documents leads many scholars to see them as written at a later point in history than Paul's life, hence as pseudepigraphical
- 1 Timothy and Titus: these 2 letters appear to contain manual-like material for organizing church life (bishop requirements, enrollment of true widows)
- 2 Timothy shares some vocabulary of the above, but it is more of a last will and testament. This genre suggests Paul was not the author
- unique language or vocabulary. Eg. guarding the deposit (*paratheke*).. wouldn't this suggest a time post-Paul where some were nervous that his writings would be forgotten. Also, Paul has less regard for religion and more regard for faithfullness.

### Circumstances leading to the writing of this correspondence

1. Guarding the deposit: suggests a concern for presevation of tradition and the ordering of communal and institutional life. Spirit doesn't just give gifts, but people can apply to be overseers
2. Concern for family or household: marriage, childbearing, obligations of caring for family members are held in high esteem (1 Tim). This contrasts to Paul's earlier message of it being better to be single. Also, household code are echoed onto slavery

Historical context of 2nd century struggles over the legacy of Paul in relation to asceticism, gnosticism, eschatology, and Jewish scriptures

- warnings against those who claim that the resurrection has already happened
- Anti-Jewish stance on law
- Jewish-myths could be a reference to certain kinds of speculative gnosticism

Pastoral Letters are "no-nonsense" religiosity

- Paul the conservative over against the opponents' Paul the radical visionary ascetic
- many contemporary practices of organized Christianity are more similar to the world reflected in the Pastoral Letters than that of the unquestioned early correspondence (eg. ordination of ministers)
- might the historical context be the struggle with the thought of Marcion? 2 Timothy 3:16 could be an argument against thinkers like Marcion, who wanted to get rid of old scriptures
- Romans 3:21 - God's justice is revealed apart from the law even though the Law and the prophets bear witness to it
- 1 Tim 6:20 - avoid contradictions which are falsely called knowledge. *Contradictions* in Greek means *Antitheses*. Could be taking a swipe at Marcion's Antitheses. Thus, these letters could be against gnosticism, in which family no longer mattered, Bible was being disbarraged, human body structure was considered insignificant. Less emphasis on the Holy Spirit or nonconformity. More so speaking to the needs of a human community in which Christ has not yet returned but wants to keep that hope alive

Pastoral letters share in Paul's passion for the salvation of the world

- prayer for rulers and a quiet and peacable mode of life is set within the context of God's desire to save everyone
- 1 Tim 3:14-16 is a capsule of the Pauline gospel as a whole

## Paul the Man

Paul is characterized by polarities

- zealous both before and after his call, while at the same time being committed to patience and humility
- vulnerable and weak, yet incomprehensibly resilient
- charismatic leader, while bringing into being communities in which the "priesthood of all believers" was realized
- larger-than-life hero, but typically works with those he calls "co-workers" or "fellow workers" of both men and women
- Paul is a Jew, but one with an identity threatening mission to non-Jews (1 Cor 9:19-23)
- Highly educated, but still choosing to earn his living in menial labour (beneath his station)

Polarity of strength and weakness lies at the heart of Paul's theology

- Jesus is the "Lord" who lived his life as a slave, eventually giving his life at the hands of the Roman empire
- consequently it informs Paul's own work as Jesus' emissary
- it informs his understanding of the character of the communities he calls "the body of Christ"

## Paul's Thought

1. Paul's view of Jesus Christ: characterized by this polarity of strength and weakness
   - Jesus the crucified was Jesus the Risen One
   - Paul does not tell Jesus stories and seldom recounts his teachings
   - Jesus is the saviour or liberator who will appear shortly to bring the event of salvation and transformation, begun with his crucifixion and resurrection to conclusion. He anticipated that the days on Earth are numbered
2. Paul was a Jew
   - Paul remained a Jew, and did not intend to start a new religion; he was rather a Jew who believed that the great moment of transformation Jews hoped for had begun in and through Jesus
3. Church: churches are thus quite appropriately cells of the future made up of both Jews and Gentiles, men and women, slaves and free
4. Spirit in its various manifestations is evidence of the in-breaking of the "new-creation", and the Torah is written onto the hearts of both Jews and Gentiles
5. Grace and justification: Grace is not only absolution but empowerment, and justification is more than "declaring innocent" but rather enabling persons to be and act justly, that is, in keeping with God's will
6. For Paul theology and ethics are fully interwoven. "In Christ" implies both identification with Jesus and with his messianic mission. Having the Spirit inhabit believers
7. Paul's ethics:
   - as seriously as Paul takes how life is lived, he was much less interested in rules than in "spirit", which is a way of recognizing divine empowerment for right and just living. Some Christians ironically interpreted this as a "new law"
   - Paul is a realist both about life in the body in what is still an "old age" and about the Spirit's enabling believers to draw on the power of the future
     - He rejects behaviour that he views as contrary to what the Torah taught about human relationships (eg. works of the flesh, don't indulge yourself.. quotes the law)
     - He rejects presuming upon grace (Rom 6); he also rejects a legalism that would lead to judgmentalism (Rom 14-15)
   - he addresses very specific issues, such as prostitution, taking each other to court, sex, eating meat offered to the pagan gods
   - Paul's appeal is not to Torah but to the believers' identification with Christ and to their relationship to the Spirit. Doesn't merely quote scripture, but applies it to who they are as vessels of the church and the Holy Spirit
