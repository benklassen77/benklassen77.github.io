## Module 1

**Objectives**: sustainability, engineering roles, system concepts

**Unsustainability**:

- climate change
  - storms, sea level rise
- species extinction
  - invasive species, habitat loss
- land use change
  - deforestation, urban sprawl
- air pollution
- social instability
  - poverty in face of excess

**Engineer**:.the application of scientific knowledge to solving  problems in the real world. While science (physics, chemistry,  biology, etc.) allows us to gain an understanding of the World and the Universe, Engineering enables this understanding to come to life  through problem solving, designing and building things

**Sustainable Development**: the process of using energy and resources at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment or ability of future gens to meet own needs. Below are several definitions

> "Traditional patterns of industrial and economic activities are no longer viable, but alternative models are not yet developed. The historical trajectory of the industrial West cannot serve as a model for the development of the industrializing countries, but it cannot be discarded entirely. Ecological systems are severely strained by the cumulative effects of past industrialization and can scarcely support added strains due to future patterns of growth, but there are major uncertainties about what must be done and how. In short, the international community as a whole is involved in a global search for new modes of development, new designs for social interaction, and new technologies for meeting evolving needs, wants, and demands." - MIT

> "Sustainable development is an intuitively powerful concept that, as commonly understood, provides a useful guide for development practitioners. It involves trade-offs between biological, economic, and social systems and is found in the interactive zone between these systems." - IIED

> "Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable -to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The concept of sustainable development does imply limits -not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology and social organization on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activity." - UN

These all have some commonality. In each of them, sustainability is prosperity for all humanity in the present and future, ethics, and the fact that each follow a cosmopolitan logic that endorses sustainability amongst the globe, not just a country.

The indigineous peoples depict Mother Earth as life-giving. The laws of nature were found, such that animals were not killed during reproductive cycles. Air, Earth, Fire, and Water fell in a unique balance. There is also the thought of everything being interconnected

We need sustainable engineering because the world is changing at a rapid rate. The complexity of the world requires different skill and knowledge than ever before.

Systems thinging changes with time. Ecological systems change w/ cycles throughout time. Social systems change with norms, and economic systems change with utility theories. See below diagram to understand how these are interconnected.

The bottom line is society, environment, and economy. In other words, people, planet, profit.

Engineers are involved deeply. Other people who are involved are social scientists, natural scientists, politicians, and the public. Below depicts an engineer's influence.

ISO assists w/ implementation and monitoring things such as carbon and ecological footprint.

Today, engineers need to be

1. Systems thinking
2. Collaborators
3. Multidisiplinary communicators
4. Cathedral builders, not bricklayers

In 2015, the UN made sustainable development goals, which are wanted to be accomplished for 2030.

## Module 2 - Fundamentals of Energy, Chemistry and Growth

### Chemistry

1 kWh = 3.6 MJ; 1mg/M = 1g/m^3 = 1ppm; 1 mcg/L = 1mg/m^3 = 1 ppb; 1gal = 3.785L; V of 1 mol of gas @ 1atm and 25 ÂºC is 22.465L and contains 6.022E23 particles; $c_w$ = 2465 $\frac{KJ}{kg}$;22.4E-3 m^3/mol;

$$\frac{mg}{m^3}=\frac{ppmv\times{mol W}}{22.465}}$$

Material Balance

- Accumulation rate = Input rate - Output rate + Reaction rate
- Steady state, input rate = output rate

### Energy

Conservation of Energy

**First Law of Thermodynamics**: energy neither created nor destroyed. Change in stored energy: $mc\Delta{T}$

- c is specific heat
- m is the mass flow rate

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**: energy is the capacity for doing work

$$n=\frac{W}{Q_h}\tag{Efficiency}$$

- W = work

Maximum efficiency $n=1-\frac{T_c}{T_h}$

- $T_c$ is temperature of cold reservoir
- $T_h$ is temperature of hot reservoir

### Population Growth

$$N_t=N_0(1+r)^t\tag{Exponential Growth}$$

- J shaped curve

$$N=N_0e^{rt}\tag{Continuous Compounding}$$

**Kaya Identity**: equality stating that the total emission level of greenhouse gas $CO_2$ can be expressed as the product of the following:

- human population
- GPA per capita
- energy intensity (per unit of GDP)
- carbon intensity (per unit of energy consumed). Measure of how clean the energy used is

$$F=P\cdot{\frac{G}{P}}\cdot{\frac{E}{G}}\cdot{\frac{F}{E}}$$

- can be manipulated to solve energy consumption and carbon emissions conceptually

**IPAT Equation**: impact comes from population, affluence, and technology

- T is seen as energy intensity

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rn(1-\frac{N}{K})\tag{Logistic Growth}$$

- S-shaped
