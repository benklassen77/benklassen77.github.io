<p>CIVE  354  covers  the  analysis,  design,  and  construction  aspects  of  foundations  (particularly shallow  foundations),  slopes,   and  retaining  structures.  The  main  objective  of  CIVE  354  is  to  enable  students  to  select  the  best  foundation solution  for  different  types  of  civil  engineering  structures.  After  completing  the  course, students  should  be  able  to  design  shallow foundations, slopes, and retaining structures for routine projects and supervise their constructions.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wide base gives more stability to structures than thin bases. All buildings are relient on the base.</p>
<p>Geotechnical engineering is a combination of differenc sciences. Soil mechanics, rock mechanics, and engineering geology are fundamental sciences that contribute to design. Applications are made for foundation design, slope design, and retaining structures. Other applicaitions include landfill design, waste containment, and subsurface remediation and cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>Geotechnical engineering</strong>: concerned with the use of earth materials for improving and defending society and life. It involves systematic application of scientific principles and techniques for constructions on, on, or with geomaterials.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation engineering</strong>: process of solving problems that involve safe and economical transfer of structural loads to the ground</p>
<p>Foundations are transition elements between the superstructure and the ground that transmit loads. Of these, shallow foundations, such as footings or rafts, are built near the ground surface. Deep foundations, such as piles or caissons, penetrate deep into the ground. Shallow foundations are often created using reinforced concrete. Piles are slender column-like structures, made of reinforced concrete (cylindrical or square), steel pipes, or H sections. Single piles under each column or multiple piles are considered a pile group, which have a rigid slab on top, known as a pile cap. Shallow foundations transfer the load in horizontal directions, while deep foundations transfer it vertically. For deep foundations, transportation and manufacturing loads must be considered.</p>

<p>Retaining structures or retaining walls are built to create space - temporary ot permanent - for a definite purpose. A retaining wall is any constructed wall that holds back soil, liquid, or other materials where there is an abrupt change in elevation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gravity retaining walls</strong>: massive walls that work on the principle of gravity for stability</li>
<li><strong>Embedded walls</strong>: slender walls that are embedded in ground for stability
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-formed walls</strong>: made of thin steel, timber, or concrete sheets that are driven into the ground. Also called sheet pile walls</li>
<li><strong>In situ walls</strong>: constructed by excavating deep trehcnes or auger holes, placing reinforcement and filling with concrete - diaphragm walls and bored pile walls are popular examples</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Composite or Hybrid Walls</strong>: composite construction using a variety of materials with a variety of support systems. They use both gravity and embedded walls</li>
</ul>
<p>Wall construction of a gravity wall follows these steps: excavation, preparing the site, constructing the wall, and putting in backfill soil. For embedded walls, you could either drive a wall or dig a trench or auger hole and pour concrete and reinforcement. You could put props or anchors as necessary</p>
<p>There are two types of slopes: natural and artificial. On basis of extent, infinite and finite. Mountain and hill slopes are natural and infinite, while hill side cuttings for road construciton; embankments for roads, railways, and canels, and earth dams and mines are all artificial and finite</p>
