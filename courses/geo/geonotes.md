**Triaxial test**: sample is first subjected to all round confinement. This is followed by vertical load applied by a piston until failure. Performed on fully saturated sands and clays, with typical height to diamater ratio 2:1 and diameter of 76mm-100mm

If there is no applied shear stress and the principal stresses are equal ($\sigma_1=\sigma_3$), shear stress on any plane is zero. This is known as **hydrostatic pressure**. See equation below:

$$\tau_{\theta}=\frac{(\sigma_1-\sigma_3)\sin{2\theta}}{2}-\sigma_{13}\cos{2\theta}$$

There are three stages to the triaxial test: consolidation, shearing, and then the final stress state. In *Stage 1*, all round confining stress is applied. In *Stage 2*, deviatoric stress is applied. This grows until it touches the mohr failure envelope.

There are 3 types of triaxial test. **Consolidated Drained** allows drainage during Stages 1 and 2. This allows no pore pressure and some volume change to be developed, and is used on sands. **Consolidated Undrained** allows drainage during Stage 1. This allows no pore pressure and some volume change in stage 1, but some pore pressure and no volume change in Stage 2, and is used on clays. **Unconsolidated Undrained** allows no drainage. Thus, there is pore pressure and no volume change, and is used only on clays.
