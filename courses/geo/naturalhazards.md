## Lecture 1

There are several trends taking place. Namely:

1. Increasing (1963-2000) Damages ($), People affected, and number of Disasters (possibly due to record keeping)
2. Decreasing (1900-2010) Deaths
3. >75% of economic damages in DCs
4. Deaths (1900-1990): >90% in LDCs, >75% of deaths from drought/famine, 10% from earthquakes
5. Very young (<10 yrs) and older (>55) people disproportionately affected
6. Realization that humans create hazard

A *natural hazard* is any natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of lofe, injury, or health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption or environmental damage. A *hazard* is an event or phenomenon with potential to create damage/loss. A *risk* is exposure of something of human value to a hazard. Includes people, goods, an environment etc. A *disaster* is the realization of hazard. *Vulnerability* comes from intersecting social, economical, and cultural factors OR physical/biological factors.

*Geophysical hazards* involve mass-movement, such as landslide, avalanche, earthquake, tsunami, erosion, volcanic eruption etc. *Meteorological hazards* involve the weather. It can include single (rain, freezing rain, hail, snow, ice) or a combination (hurricanes, ice storm, thunderstorm, tornado). *Hydrological hazard* involves water. Such as a flood, storm surge, tidal, wave action, drought, and glacial advance. *Biological hazard* involves invasive species, epidemics. *Technological* hazard and *nat-tech* (nuclear) hazards involve technology.

*Complex hazards* involve a combination of factors. Hurricanes are the *primary* storm which can cause extreme weather and a storm surge. Secondary effects include wildfire, landslide, flood, erosion, and biological diseases from floods.

The *levee* effect indicates that people may feel safe with a levee even if they are still at risk.

## Lecture 2

**Disaster**: in the USA, it is defined by a the FEMA Process as the capability of the State to respond. 3 steps

1. State/federal officials conduct a preliminary damage assessment (PDA)
2. Governor of the affected state makes disaster request to US President, demonstrating that disaster is beyond the capabilities of the local government and that federal assistance is necessary
3. Governor's request made through regional FEMA office

In *Canada*,disaster is defined as capability of provinces to pay for the disaster

|Eligible provincial expenses (per capita of population)|Government of Canada percentage|
|---|---|
|First \$3.27|0|
|Next \$6.56|50|
|Next \$6.56|75|
|Remainder|90|

Factors triggering disaster include:

- *Time* (rapid vs. slow-onset,unpredictable vs. predictable, rare vs. common)
- *Complexity* (cascading events)
- *Spatial connections* [localized (like lightning) vs. extensive (like hurricane), expected vs. unexpected in a place]

There are zones defining the spatial aspects of disasters.

1. *Total Impact*: deaths, severe damage, structural collapse
2. *Marginal Impact Zone*: injuries and some damage
3. *Filtration Zone*: no physical damage, many refugees
4. *Organised Community Aid*: local relief
5. *National &  International Aid*: international disaster relief supplies and personnel

In Belgium (CRED classification), a disaster has >10 people dead or >100 people affected. A significant disaster has greater than 100 death, economic damage greater than 1% of GDP, or greater than 1% of population affected.

In the Emergency Management Framework for Canada,a *disaster* is when 10+ ppl killed, 100+ ppl affected, an appeal for national/international assistance is made, historical significance is clear, and there is significant damage/interruption of normal processes such that the community affected cannot recover on its own

It is also challenging to measure disaster deaths. Through time, disasters are less and less directly a result from the initial disaster. Also, losses are hard to define. There are direct, indirect, tangible (\$ value), and intangible (hard to define \$ value).

There are several paradigms that have been experienced throughout the ages. See below:

![Paradigms](https://i.imgur.com/DiTHvCb.png?1)

**Land-use planning**: how we decide how to use the land available to us. Done by considering what is the 'best' use of land in-relation to a community's objectives. Factors considered includes the community, economic, environmental, and social factors that are considered.

Why are some communities exposed to hazards?

- Some communities weigh the relative importance of the factors differently
- The importance/influence of land-use planning differs from place-to-place
- Our understanding of the hazards communities are exposed to differ
- The enforcement of land-use planning differs
- People have to live somewhere and sometimes they don't get much choice

How are economic factors considered?

- Value of opportunities (natural ports, navigable waterways, agricultural value)
- Scarcity (limited available land and high economic need)
- Amenity value (scenic, recreational opportunity, proximity to desirable goods)

The environment, social factors, health, and safety are all also considerations

Climate change is a driver of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

- *Hazard* because CC enhances the frequency and severity of many natural hazards
- *Exposure* because CC is causing the emergence of previously unfamiliar or uncommon hazards
- *Vulnerability* because CC brings both new vulnerabilities and exacerbates existing ones

## Lecture 3

### Amanda Ripley "The Unthinkable: Lessons from Survivors"

- Stoicism is the norm
- Humans make themselves believe that there is not a risk

Human Responses to Disaster occur in a few stages:

1. Denial
2. Deliberation
3. Decisive Moment

### Human responses to hazards

Threats of hazards and most disasters trigger some level of response from humans. Different actors include:

- individuals
- neighbourhoods
- communities
- private industry
- NGOs
- governments (minicipal/township, provinces/territories, federal)
- international communities (UN)
- media

Human psychology, or one's perception of the hazard, has a large impact on there response. Responses also depend on:

- perception
- opportunity
- motivation to act (past experience?)
- resources at hand

### DRR Toolkit

*Disaster risk reduction*: the policy objective aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk, all of which contributes to strengthening resilience

*Disaster risk management*: the application of disaster risk reduction policies, processes and actions to prevent new risk, reduce existing disaster risk and manage residual risk contributing to the strengthening of resilience

There are three primary options to respond to a disaster:

1. Bear the loss (do nothing)
2. Share the loss, through insurance or family/friends
3. Reduce the loss potential by moving, midifying the potential for a hazard, and reduce human vulnerability through protection (structures) or non-structural vulnerability reduction

The first two primary options are passive, and the second one is active. People do nothing because they don't have the resources or capacity. They might also just have no other choice.

Bearing the loss in LCDs (lowest developed countries) happens because powerful social forces influence LDC citizens and make hazards impossible to share or reduce. This is due to poverty and powerlessness, population and land pressure, lack of alternative employment, lack of education and information, and lack of access to credit.

Sharing the loss is spreading individual loss through insurance, neighbour/family assistance, aid, and private appeals like GoFundMe.

Reducing the loss is done in a couple different ways:

1. *Total prevention*: see below for some prevention methods. Some hazards, like earthquakes, are beyond total prevention
	- ![Prevention methods](https://i.imgur.com/cXQeSLa.png?1)
	- Floods: dams, spillways, levees
	- Biohazards: public health programs, quarantines/import restrictions
2. *Magnitude reduction*: done to improve results
	- Cloudseeding to address drought
	- Flood reduction with afforestation, diversion channels, stormwater ponds
	- Wildfre prescribed burns

|Storm|Structure|
|---|---|
|Cyclonic storm|Seawall, breakwater, beach stabilization|
|Volcano|Lahar diversion channel|
|Flood|Urban dike|
|Avalanche|Diversion structure, snow shed, artillery and explosion, energy absorption mounds, snow fencing, tree planting|

Reducing human vulnerability is done by adjusting people and property to reduce/minimise loss. There is a large diversity of potential adjustments:

- predictions, forecasts and warnings
- risk assessment/mapping
- regional planning, land use planning and zoning
- financial and tax incentives
- protection structures
- building codes and hazard resistant design
- public education
- emergency preparedness
- disaster management and reduction

In the context of risk mapping, *risk* is estimated as the sstatistical probability of occurrence. *Risk assessment* is the process of estimating probability of occurrence for one location. *Risk mapping* represents varaible (multiple) risks within an area and is usually contour mapping (each line represents the same statistical probability of occurrence. Does not reduce human vulnerability on its own, but only decisions and adjustments based on risk mapping reduce vulnerability

There are different types of maps: single hazard maps, multiple hazard maps, historical hazard maps, and critical facilities maps with hospitals, fire stations, and water treatment/sewage

Regional planning, land use, planning and zoning all occur over time. *Regional planning* includes broad decision-making at regional scale. *City master planning* includes gathering and analyzing information about suitability of land for different purposes. *Zoning* includes mapping of decisions made about appropriate (allowed) and inappropriate (not allowed) uses of land. This is known as the watershed -> neighbourhood scale.

Risk assessment and mapping impacts land use planning and zoning. Risk assessment and mapping uses: hazard identification and vulnerability analysis, mapping hazard areas vs. non-hazard areas, safe/unsafe locations for critical infrastructure (hospitals, fire stations, water treatment plants, sewer systems, transportation).

Zoning has many benefits. It is easy to monitor/reinforce, builds awareness of the hazard, and guides compensation after disasters. High hazard zones limit settmenent or high cost investments. Low hazard zones are given to critical facilities, residential, commercial, industrial, or transport corridors.

Financial and tax incentives have several uses as well. They can stop development in hazardous areas, direct new development to safer areas, and upgrade development in hazardous areas by denying insurance, retrofit subsidising, lower tax rates in less-risk areas etc.

Emergency preparedness is also very important. All the important stakeholders need to be involved in this. See below:

![Preparedness](https://i.imgur.com/MFXNUsd.png?1)

## Earthquakes

An *earthquake* is a generic term for any earth vibration no matter what cause, such as volcano, meteorite impact, landslide, explosion, or fault movement. Plate tectonics cause fault movements

More than 1000 earthquakes between 1900-2000 with more than 2M deaths. The deadliest earthquake zone is indonesia-himalayas-china/india-middleeast-N.Africa. Here, unreinforced masonry is common in buildings, and this is not good in earthquake. Why? Unreinforced masonry is strong in compression. Brick/cement can resist 2000 psi. However, it is weak in tension. Brick/cement can resist only 400 psi. Some spray cement materials can be used to retrofit existing structures to become more ductile. This is important because mosst deaths are due to falling materials.

There are a series of events that occurs in earthquakes:

1. *Structural collapse*: majority of death and property damage
2. *Associated natural and nat-tech hazards*: landslides or tsunamis
3. Ecological/habitat change
4. Phychocosial impacts
5. Economic impacts

See below for earthquake hazards:

![Earthquake hazards](https://i.imgur.com/CuqpLIo.png?2)

Other factors include:

- *Time of day*: impacts earthquakes because it gives people less time to respond
- *Magnitude*: energy released over what area
- *Depth*: shallower earthquakes are most damaging. The closer to the surface the epicenter of the earthquake is, the more it is felt
- *Location*: proximity to human populations, terrestrial vs. undersea earthquakes
- *Duration*: how long it will last

There are 4 main types of shockwaves:

1. **Primary P Wave**: compressional or push-pull wave that can be heard. Fastest (>20000 kms/hr) and are the first to be felt
2. **Secondary S Wave**: vertical transverse, or wiggling wave that is generally the most damaging due to shaking effects
3. **Love Wave**: side-to-side horizonal motion that create lots of damage
4. **Rayleigh Wave**: backward rotating motion (vertical and horizontal); highly damaging. "Feels like a boat at sea"

Earthquakes are measured based on intensity and magnitude. The *intensit* is what it feels like. Includes effects on people and buildings, can be used to examine historical people's observations, low technology, and is measured iwth *Modified Mercalli Scale*. The *magnitude* determines quantitatively how big it is by measuring energy released. The *Richter scale* is good for nearby, moderate earthquakes with low/medium technology. The *Moment Magnitude scale* looks at energy released through the rigidity of rock X rupture area X slip length. This requires high technology and is best for high magnitude earthquakes

Here are more general definitions:

- *Aftershock*: quakes which follow a mainshock
- *Swarm*: clusters of quakes closely spaced in time and space, with no "mainshock"
- *Storm (theory)*: earthquakes create stress further along fault, which can cause another quake months or years later. This could meann independent but related earthquakes

The level of earthquake vulnerability is the result of expectation, seismicity of the area, building design, construction standards and site preparation, individual vulnerabilities (age etc), pre-disaster preparedness, post-disaster services, geological features, and timing (did it happen during a music festival?)

**Liquefaction**: the process whereby soil saturaed with water is shaken by an earthquake, causing the soil to lose its ability to support loads and begin to behave like a liquid

In the future, due to Storm theory, Tokyo, Istanbul and Vancouver could be hit by another earthquake soon.

DRR comes in these forms:

- Education
- Evacuation planning
- Building inspection
- Building code review/update
- Critical facilities relocation
- Emergency budget
- Zoning
- Tsunami structural protection
- Emergency preparedness planning
- First responder training

## Volcanos

There are more than 500 active volcanoes worldwide, with 90% at the edges of tectonic plates. Zones of volcanism are often called earthquake zones. There are a couple types:

- **Rift volcanoes**: these are known as spreading centres. Places where tectonic plates separate from each other. Lots of magma is visible, little explosivity
- **Subduction zones**: mostly on land, lots of explosivity, little magma (eg. St. Helens)
- **Hot spots**: remaining 10%. Masses of slowly rising mantle magma can emerge away from edges of tectonic plates

1300 volcanoes erupted in the last 10000 years. <Half are now considered active (510-530). Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant (potentially active) and extenct. There is no certainty to classification. For example, in 1951 Mt. Lamington erupted and killed 5000.

Primary hazards:

- **Pyroclastic flow**: 70% of all killed
- Blasts
- Primary lahar
- Airfall tephra (dust/ash, cinders/bombs)
- Lava
- Volcanic smog, or VOG

Secondary hazards:

- Secondary lahar
- Earthquake and cone collapse
- Landslide/debris avalanche
- Tsunami
- Famine

A pyroclastic flow is a fast-moving (up to 700 km/hr) extremely hot (~1000 °C) mass of air and debris that charges down the sides of a volcano during an explosive eruption.

When pyroclastic materials mix with water from a nearby stream or river, they can turn the watercourse into a fast moving mudflows. These are called lahars;[11] when the lahar contains large material such as blocks of rock and trees, it is a volcanic debris flow.[12] Lahars can form directly from a pyroclastic material flow flowing into a river, or could possibly form after the main eruption. The latter are referred to as secondary lahars

Previously, most deaths were due to secondary hazards. Now, most are due to direct hazards.

- humans settle on active/dormant volcanoes
- recreation
- tourism

Volcano severity is measured with the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). VEI 5 every 10 years, VEI 7 every hundred years. VEI includes volume of ejeca, eruption height, eruptive style, and duration of the continuous blast.

Monitoring and prediction is done for volcanoes. These include seismic, ground deformation, VOG chemistry, water chemistry, thermal, magnetic-gravitational-electrical, visual, and spiritual/traditional knowledge

The Merapi 2010 Disaster had >375 people killed, >300000 evacuated, and thousands of flights changed. Secondary lahars continue to impact communities years later. The city of Yogyakarta (3M people) is high risk.

Prior to 2010, warning systems, evacuation planning, monitoring systems (seismograph, deformation meters, spiritual monitor), hazard mapping, and a volcano bunker. See event details below:

To reduce risk:

1. Education: science + traditional knowledge
2. Build better trust with government/scientist
3. Livestock insurance
4. Enforcement checkpoints for evacuation
5. Prior protection of monuments
6. Porous urban infrastructure
7. More evac shelters
8. Awareness signage
9. Assisted evacuation
10. Improve existing evacuation shelters
11. Better engineering future evac shelters

## Tsunami

*Tsu* means harbour and *nami* means wave. Tsunamis are caused by rapid movement of sea water. Undersea earthquake (vretical seabed displacement) is the most common cause of tsunamis. They are also caused by volcanic explosion and mass-movement events like landslides

The Minoan Civilization was impacted by a volcanic eruptio, which triggered a tsunami, The Japanese have also been impacted by tsunamis over the years. Thus, tsunami stones have been created to warn people. Some researchers study ways to communicate risk across generations.

*Tsunami scouring*: vegetation killed by tsunami

Waves travel at 600-850 km/hr (400-520 mph) in deep ocean. In shallow water, they only travel at 100 km/hr. Tsunamis are not like a pancake; they are more like a pancake. They cam flow inlandd many 100s of meters. Typically, there are multiple tsunamis from an event. They are most dangerous with shallow topography, harbours and bays, and lagoons. See below for tsunami frequency.

![Tsunami frequency](https://i.imgur.com/AozIRAH.png?1)

90% of tsunamis are in the pacific. There are about 2 damaging tsunami/year. 50000 deaths in the last year. The 2004 event had more than 275000 deaths. More than 25% are in Japan/Taiwan, and 153 events in Hawaii over 175 years.

Hazard components inlude:

1. Drowning
2. Impact with debris/objects
3. Scouring
4. Lifting/buoyancy

Survival is impacted by:

1. Time of day + Distance from ocean
2. Populations at risk
3. Vulnerability
4. Understanding warning signs
5. DRR

Overall, this is determined by socioeconomic status

**Maximum wave run-up**: height of foundation above sea level + height of wave above ground

Tsunami hazards are predicted through a combination of:

- Seismograph (earthquake)
- Tide gauges (unusual wave movement)
- Bottom pressure recorders (shock wave)
- Pacific tsunami warning system (26 member countries; centred in Honolulu) - when tsunami detected, >100 regional centres are notified in less than 60 minutes with the earthquake location, magnitude, predicted wave arrival times for tsunami prediction

Prior to 2011, Japan had seawalls, tsunami drills, sensors and alarms, industrial shutdown protocol, communication at the pac tsunami center, nuclear power backup systems, and an education -> awareness -> action plan. Additional DRRs could be structural adjustment (higher seawall), thorough disaster analysis, improve community protocol, design criteria, securing loose items, and accounting for land drop.

Vertical evacuation structures are commonly used to allow those at a low level to get to a higher level

**Resettlement**: multiple projects to resettle entire communities. Most have now been scaled back or cancelled

In the Japanese tsunami, there were also "industrial" DRRs (nuclear failure). Some areas in Japan have a comprehensive tsunami-resistant cities plan that makes use of nature. A nature-based solution has actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. See below:

![Japan situation](https://i.imgur.com/Tx4AmnL.png?1)

In the above, ecosystems are being restored through evacuation hills and the coastal disaster prevention forest. Greenspace is also created, which supports mental health, creates a hang-out spot, and reduces urban greenisland effect.

## Japan Earthquake

1. S-wave

Fukushima plant survived due to the coolant and shutting the reactor cores off. 4 miiles below the surface of the water from Japan, tectonic plates had a collision. Japan lies at the point where the pacific plate lies into the urasian plate at 3cm a year. Like an elastic band that had been wound up for hundreds of years. Lots of built-up energy

The quake went on for around 5 minutes. Expected to go on for 10 seconds to a minute.

Magnitude 9 earthquake happened here. The upward motion of the plate thrust a 4 mile deep mass of water upwards.

Tsunamis travel faster in deep water and reaches land more quickly. Also, the layout of the land: cliffs, inlets along the shoreline etc. impacts the wave height.

30ft seawalls existed - miako's walls were useless. The wave breached them. Although the 30ft walls were the same height as the waves, the earthquake caused the coastline to drop by up to 3 ft. This lowered the walls and make the tsunami worse. The waves also went over fukushima's tsunami wall, which flooded the diesel lines. Backup battery used with an 8 hour charge remained.

In the deep ocean, the water was 3ft high. This hit hawaii 3 hours later. Because of the warning system, the people of hawaii got to higher ground and were save (no deaths). Eventually, the wave hit California with much less energy. Only one person lost life

The tsunami eventually reached an 8km mountain top community (Ofunato), where it formed a saltwater lake. Some communities were completely written off the map.

In the week that followed the initial earthquake, there were over 500 aftershocks. Each aftershock could trigger others to happen. The energy from one goes to another. As a result, hundreds of thousands are homeless.

In the nuclear power plant, the batteries die and there's no power to cool the reactor. Temperatures rise, water levels drop, pressure builts, and hydrogen gas is generated from the fuel rods. Seawater was dumped on the powerplant, but didn't work. Hydrogen explosions happened.

Speculation happened that another earthquake under toyko would occur due to the stresses transferred from the other quake.

## Cyclonic storms

*Cyclonic storms* are referred to as hurricanes/typhoons/cyclones. Storm surge is a key part of the damage from these events. Tornadoes are alos cyclonic storms.

*Cyclonic storm* is an air mass that is rotating around low-pressure core over warm tropical waters. 15% of the world's population is at risk from these. Stages/categories include:

1. Tropical disturbance
2. Tropical depression <18 m/s
3. Tropical storm 18-32 m/s
4. Hurricane 32 m/s

See categories of hurricanes here:

![Hurricanes](https://i.imgur.com/0cFJSGK.png?1)

See below for storm tide:

![Storm Tide](https://i.imgur.com/VmeBUen.png?1)

- **Storm surge**: a bulge of water pushed ahead of the tropical cyclone caused by rotational winds and forward motion of hurricane. It is the greatest potential threat to life and property
- **High winds**: typically, higher winds leads to greater damage (unless mitigation in place)
- **Heavy rain and flooding**: many tropical cyclones can produce rainfall amounts of 15-30 cm. Slower moving storms produce more rain than faster moving storms
- **Tornadoes** can be a by-product of hurricanes. Eventually, mold is another byproduct that can impact health

### Distribution and Frequency

As seen in the video of Hurricane Katrina, storm surge can arrive days before the storm hits. Evacuation needs to happen well in advance of the storm hitting to prevent people from getting stranded

On average, there are 85-90 named storms per year (only 10 in North America). Northwest Pacific has the greatest frequency (Philippines and Japan). Costliest events have occurred in the USA and Japan, and Bangladesh is the most vulnerable (7 or 9 deadliest cyclones). Named storms are typically at 4 and higher. In more developed countries (like USA and Japan), the biggest cost is valuable stuff rather than loss of life. In LDCs (like Bangladesh), more life loss.

**Energy source**: the ocean absorbs atmospheric heat. Water evaporates, transporting energy to the atmosphere. Water vapour cools with altitude and condenses, releasing energy and driving hurricane formation and growth. Due to climate change, more energy is available. This is leading to more hurricanes.

At Hurricane Harvey, climate change contributed to rainfall exceeding 60 inches.

Cyclonic storms are the 4th greatest killer.

1. Biohazards
2. Droughts
3. Floods
4. Cyclonic storms

Annual damages exceed 25B, annual deaths exceed 10000. Katrina cost more than 160B and Harvey more than 125B. *Nargis* in myanmar (2008) caused more than 150000 deaths and more than 10B in damages. It is an emerging trend in hazard warnings to clearly communicate the likely impacts on individuals if they do not evacuate/protect themselves. During the storm surge, caskets can also rise from the ground.

India is a prime example of a country that was protected. $250M was invested in DRR since a disaster in 1998. Community leaders and shelters and drills were erected. Over 1M people were eevacuated

Cyclonic storms under climate change are described below:

1. *Sealevel rise* is virtually guaranteed because of climate change
2. *Cyclonic storm intensity* is likely to increase because of additional atmospheric head causes higher temperature
3. *Greater storm surge threats* due to higher intensity and sealevel rise
4. *No change in cyclonic frequency*: some conditions under CC favourable to TC formation others less favourable

## Tornadoes

*Tornado Alley* in Midwest USA is a place with the greatest frequency of tornadoes. 70% of all tornadoes here (>900/year) and 150 deaths/year

The most deadly tornado happened in Bangladesh. Here, 2 tornadoes killed 700 & 1300 people.

Hazard components include:

- low pressure
- lifting
- wind
- debris movement

See below for *EF (enhanced fujita)* scale:

![EF](https://i.imgur.com/ULlXEkw.png?1)

While Tornadoes appear to happen more frequently over time, it is likely that there is just much better detection. Over time, damage deaths and costs are decreasing.

|Hurricane|Tornado|
|---|---|
|<100 named storms/year|1000-2000 tornadoes/year|
|>10000 deaths|50-200 deaths|
|>\$25B damage|\$5B damage|
|25-50 countries affected|<10 countries regularly affected|

Because of this, hurricane is major hazard and tornado is medium hazard.

There are primary and secondary health impacts. *Primary* includes drowning, trauma, disease from water, cardiovascular stress, hypothermia, and mental health impacts. *Secondary* impacts include electrocution, burns, social system health, respiratory issues, and mental health impacts

For instance, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a 4 storm with 1000s of deaths. Originally only 644 deaths, but due to indirect deaths, 2500-8000 deaths. Many of these people died because they could not access medical care or medical supplies. Calculation of these deaths was done using epidemiological methods to identify excess deaths.

Prior to Hurricane Maria as much as 30% of Puerto Rico's GPD came from the production of medical products (eg. IV bags, pharmaceuticals, saline etc). Many factories were damaged or could not access supplies or electricity, creating supply issues to North America

Cyclonic Storm DRR includes retrofitting houses, having insurance, making new building codes, land use zoning, and disaster preparedness

- The standard homeowner insurance does not cover flooding. Storm surges=flooding. Land use planning can be reassessed after natural disasters occur

## Week 8 - Extreme Wind

See below for common winter storm hazard types:

![Winter Hazard Types](https://i.imgur.com/1tXkA91.png?1)

See below for impacts of Texas Winter Storm:

![Texas Winter Storm](https://i.imgur.com/uuJAGhC.png?1)

In 1998, the Quebec Ice Storm hit.

- >80 hours of freezing rain
- Some houses without electricity/heating for 5 weeks

As a result of the storm, there were more than 5B in damage. Infrastructure and property were damaged, forest resources were damaged, there was lost productivity (20% of employed Canadians lost work), and there were 45 deaths.

There are almost 40000 thunderstorms daily. In these, there are strong winds, rain, hail, lightning, tornados, and waterspouts. Overall, there are also 100 lgihtning strikes per second, billions of damages from hail, and intense rain/flash flooding.

There are 3 stages of thunderstorm development: developing, mature, and dissipating. Hot air with masses rising up -> downburst with strong updraft -> rain wants to come down.

*Windshear*: local variations in windspeed, in either vertical or horizontal directions. Dangerous for flying. *Microbursts* can be associated with windshear - these can cause damage to trees. Plane crashes are nav-tech disasters.

Supercell Thunderstorms are isolated, extremely powerful rotating thunderstorms. The intense, rotating updraft that sustains mature thunderstorms can last for up to 6 hours. These can produce tornadoes, extremely large hailstorms, hurricane strength winds and flash floods. Stormchasers refer to supercells as the mothership because tornadoes can drop down from them.

Different states have different lightning deaths because there are fewer storms in relative states regardless of proximite.

Hailstorms can disrupt agriculture. Additionally, it can cause massive flooding once it melts.

## Wildfires

Wildfire: wildfire is classified as a biohazard. In reality, it is a biophysical hazard

Recipe for wildfires: high wind, low humidity, prior drought, fire suppression, sleep slopes, ignition source

25%+ of fires in California are caised by arson. The top two Australian bushfires had arson and other components of the recipe. See below:

![Australian Fire](https://i.imgur.com/uo4cx0f.png?1)

The level of heat in the 2013 Australian fire was nearly impossible without climate change. After fires, erosion and smoke are secondary hazards. Additionally, debris flow is possible.

*Wildland urban Interface Fire (WUIF)*: any fire which is located at or near the intermix zone of forest and urban development, and contains both wildland fuel and urban fuel. This is basically any fire that is close enough to a city that it has urban fuel sources as well as natural.

In the 2016 Fort McMurray WUIF, 2400 buildings were destroyed, 88000 people evacuated, 5900 km2 burnt, 10B damages. There was no record of lightning, so it is likely human caused. The recipe: 32 decrees Celcius, 12% humidity, greater than 70 km/hr winds

The health impacts of wildfires disproportionally impact the vulnerable, such as those with respiratory conditions. There is inequity in community ability to respond. Additionally, with more extreme WUID, there has been impacts to water quality

Post Fire DRR includes:

- have buffer zones (increase size between wildlands/urban areas)
- home construction (rebuild with fire resistant materials)
- reduce urban fuel source (decorative bush, wooden fence)
- cut off fire pathways (elements which connect embers to home, like wood mulch)
- decrease housing density (limits home-to-home spread)

WUIF risk reduction

- *Zoning*: limit urban expansion into wildfire-prone areas
- *Fuel reduction*: clearing fuel sources around home
- *Home design*: non-combustible materials
- *Education*: new homeowners
- *Forecasts -> warnings -> evacuation* plans
- *Disaster preparedness*: all levels of the public aware

## Floods

Floods are one of the most common natural hazards affecting more than 200M people per year. They range from slow (snowmelt) to rapid (flash flood) onset.

River and Lake floods include regional (slow onset and dissipation) and flash floods (rapid onset and dissipation). Coastal flood types include storm-driven (rapid onset and dissipation), tsunami (rapid onset and dissipation), and sea level rise to coastal inundation (slow onset, no dissipation)

Floods are located anywhere there are floodplains, coasts/deltas, non-permeable surfaces, alluvial fans, valley bottoms/slot canyons and human settlement. The most hazardous countries are bangladesh, Vietnam, and China. Bangladesh is 80% a floodplain

Floods are the most common type of disaster. See below:

![Flood Frequency](https://i.imgur.com/0p15Duo.png?1)

Floods are third largest killer. 1 is biohazard, 2 is drought, 3 is flood, and 4 is cyclonic storm or earthquakes. Floods are also the most costly damages in the world.

Floods also havr more obvious benefit than any other hazard:

1. Maintains wetlands
2. Recharges aquifers
3. Soil fertility
4. Natural irrigation
5. Maintains river health
6. Creates new habitat

Flood hazard components include:

1. Lateral forces (pushing) with water, debris, or ice
2. Buoyancy (lifting)
3. Erosion (scouring)
4. Sediment deposit
5. Drowning
6. Cold
7. Wetting (mold)

River floods are measured with:

1. Height (Stage)
	- Base -> Water surface
2. Speed (m/s)
3. Discharge (Volume)
4. Frequency (recurrence interval)

1997 Red River Flood Case Study

- Flood of the century (1:225 yr event)
- Serious flooding predicted in February. April blizzard dumped 50cms of snow. There was deep snow and then rapid snowmelt. There was also frozen, saturated ground and a shallow topographs. Ice-covered rivers downstream. The military built a 40km dike around Winnipeg but this wasn't sufficient. The river was 30km wide instead of the normal 100m. 2500 homes were flooded and many were evacuated
- There wer some human dimensions. The watershed changed - the once tall grass prairie had become plowed fields. Wetland reclamation, or destruction, had taken place to make the land available for other things. Urban paved surfaces and sikes and levees were all created
- Climate change may have played a role in the likelyhood of the snowfall occuring
- The flood impacted people socioeconomically with lost assets, mental and physical impacts, and cultural/spiritual impacts. First Nations people evacuated.
- A dike and spillway system was present to divert water from the city of Winnipeg.
- Red River Floodway completed in 1968 (360M Canadian), expanded after 1997 flood for another 660M CDN, designed to divert a 1 in 700 flood. Estimated to save upwards of 10 billion in damage savings. While this can protect the more valuable assets, this can also divert more water to some areas, affecting people more.

Raised houses, buoyant houses, and diked houses are all ways to make houses more flood-resistant. In order to create/worsen flood hazards, we often:

- ignore flood histories
- occupy floodplains
- increase settlement densities
- anchor naturally shifting channels (levees, dredging, dikes) (instead of allowing rivers to naturally shift, we control the area)
- levee effect: believe that levees will work and build new developments behind
- urbanize and pave
- insurance can promote risky behaviour
- remove vegetation and drain wetlands
- incorrectly calculate flood recurrence
- dont invest in warming systems
- amenity based vulnerability
- socio economic vulnerability
- climate change

*Drought*: prolonged dry period in a natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. Slow onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in water shortage.

- Meteorological, socioeconomical, hydrorlogical, and agricultural drought

*Famine*: see different definitions below

![Famine](https://i.imgur.com/dRDWpWP.png?1)

- Main cause of famine politics
- DRR includes pre-emptive aid, better planning, more active international collaboration, and long-term investments in building back better such as conflict resolution, better infrastructure, empowering rural communities, and connecting to markets. *FEWS* is famine early warning system.

## Mass movement events

4 types: rock/sediment-based, avalanche, erosion, thermal erosion

**Mass movement**: displacement of surface materials down-slope under the force of gravity. Either rapid (landslide/rockfall, mudslice, snow avalanche) or slow (erosion, creep, sweeling soils, frost heave. Range of mass movement includes: falling, toppling, sliding, flowing, soil creep and erosion, and subsidence

Some notable events include Venezuela 1999; Palu, Indonesia; and Petropolis, Brazil. In the 70s, there were more than 600 deaths per year. From 90s-2010, there are more than 5-8000 deaths/year. Deadliest events include 830000 deaths (Shaanxi, China 1556) and 30-50000 deaths (Caracas, Venezuela 1999)

*Subsidence*: causes are groundwater pumping, underground mining, vibration, plate tectonic activity, and natural dissolution (limestone/karst)

The worldwide distribution is as follows: 90% of deaths along Pacific Rim (steepness of terrain, population, heavy rainfall, environmental change, settlement in steep areas.

There is a clear relationship between rain and mass movement. The more rain, the more landslides.

In Venezuela, humans built on a floodplain. This is the reason for the 50000+ death toll.

- All flat land = alluvial fan.
- Ineffective hazard mitigaiton
- Very low awareness of hazard
- No urban planning restrictions
- Mamny residents new to area or second home owners
- Motivaiton to allow construction: taxes etc.
- Deforestation played no roll

Erosion is often not seen as a hazard or disaster. However it is slow. This makes it natural/normal and invisible. It can also trigger rapid onset events like landslides. It is linked to floods/flash floods, coastal storm surge, volcanic eruption, dust storm, and drought. Altogether, *erosion* is defined as movement of rock, sediment, or soil by erosive agents. Water, temperature, wind, glacial scouring, faulting, and vegetation/wildlife play a role. The most important types of erosion are coastal, soil, and thermal.

Erosion is caused by:

1. Natural physical processes (wind, water, storms etc)
2. Natural Causes
	- Ground disturbance (farming/construction)
	- Changes in water flod
	- Vegegation disturbance/removal/change
		- Deforestation
		- Grazing
	- Human Settlement
	- Climate Change

*Creeping* moves mms-cms/year. *Thermal (or thermally-related) erosion*: direct with permafrost melting or indirect with ice cap melt -> sea level rise -> erosion.

There is a feedback look with climate change. More temperature -> More permafrost thaw -> more greenhouse gas release -> more temperature etc..

Avalanche: special category of mass movement where snow is the mass. There are several triggers, including ,skiing or snowmobiling, noise, or temperature and rain. There is a smaller range of slopes that they occur on compared to other mass movement events (20-60 degrees). Most occur within 30-45 degrees of slopes. The origins are fracture points within a snowpack resulting from slope changes, cornice fall, poorly bonded layers, or human triggers.

There are two types of avalanche.

1. Loose snow: there is poor internal cohesion. The hazard is inhalation/suffocation. It can occur in wet or dry snow
2. Slab: most destructure. This has the greatest energy and can destroy buildings. Often triggers other avalanches. Death occurs by crushing an inhalation.

Avalanche speeds range from creep to greater than 350 kms/hr.

![Avalanche Scale](https://i.imgur.com/IUIiZj0.png?1)

The NAPADS is also used. See below:

![NAPADS](https://i.imgur.com/FU88RZY.png?1)

Avalanches occur in high mountain cold environments, and are almost always associated with skiing/snowboarding, climbing, and other recreation. There are less than 250 deaths per year and millions of dollars in damage.

Since people are the primary trigger of avalanches, and people experience COVID fatigue, there has recently been a record number of deaths.

![Physical Avalanche DRR](https://i.imgur.com/55cQTl3.png?1)

Pre-emptive blasting is also done to prevent big avalanches. The mountain information network is important for avalanche forecasting.

## Biohazards

*Biological hazard*: human epidemic; plant epidemic; animal epidemic; invasions (introduced species) like cane toad, purple loosestrire, and invasive carp

They are the most wide-ranging category of hazards, and by far the most deadly category of hazards. Millions of deaths per ears. Often not considered a natural hazard, not because of technical reasons, but due to expertise and public perceptions

> **Natural Hazard**: any *natural process or phenomenon* that may cause *loss of life*, *injury or health impacts*, property damage, loss of *livelihood and services*, *social and economic disruption or environmental damage*

Invasive Species: present in an area outside their natural range. They are often relocated intentionally by humans - these species have an adverse effect when living outside their natural range

Invasive species are a hazard due to *environmental* costs, *economic* costs, or *health* implications.

DRR is very context dependent. The best defence is preventing the spread of species.

Plant disease can have economic implications and environmental. Dircetly impact humans by influencing food supply (Irish Potato Famine). We can see impacts of plant disease in communities today (Dutch Elm Disease)

*Dutch Elm Disease*: fungus spread from tree to tree by elm bark beetles. Arrived in North America in the 30s by infected lumber. Many elm trees have  died.

Infectious diseasses are caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi.

*Zoonotic desease*: disease that transfers from animals to people. The other way is called reverse zoonosis. MANY diseases lately have been zoonotic (Ebola, HIV, Lyme, H1N1, H5N1, COVID-19). Altogether, 61% are zoonotic. &5% of emerging diseases are zoonotic.

*Vector-borne* disease: when an animal transmits a disease to a human. Malaria, West Nile, Lyme. Malaria was at one point an issue in Canada - likely because of British soldiers in rotation.  Construction had to stop on the Rideau Canal.

The 1918 flu was known as the Spanish Flu, Russian Pest, German Flu, the Brazilian Flu etc. intentionally.

Infectious disease DRR: outbreak management/emergency preparedness, monitoring and surveillance, systems approach, education-training-capacity building, building resilient health systems.

One Health: public health initiative seeking to encompass various fields in the pursuit of successful preventative healthcare. It is new cohesive articulation of existing ideas. Human health systems + veterinary medicine + environmentl management. It was quick, well funded, multisectoral response to the 2005 Avian flu outbreak. Would cost 3.4B per year to install the necessary permanent infrastructure in developing countries with expected return of 37B per year.

Prevention happens with:

- surveillance systems
- ecological protection
- work to address systemic issues
- vaccination programs
- other activities that improve health status

Intervention techniques depend on the hazard. Includes:

- physical barriers
- medication
- vaccination

![Outbreak Response](https://i.imgur.com/RcdGPzN.png?1)

Determinants of health include upstream factors, like socioeconomic status and the environment, and downstream factors, like behaviours that flow from upstream determinants. EG. quality of parenting can prevent against drugs.

## Disaster Response Cycle & Build Back Better Paradigm

Disaster response cycle is as follows (BBB is build, back, better):

![DRC1](https://i.imgur.com/7df1mBf.png?1)

![DRC2](https://i.imgur.com/FWTsDq2.png?1)

Pre-19302, disasters were seen as "Acts of God". Between 1930s-1960s, behavioural and structural paradigms were used. From 1990s-present, unnatural disasters paradigm are used. Furthermore, from 2004-present, build back better (post-disaster). Since 2010, build resilience has been used.

A *paradigm* is a way of thinking about a problem. Includes systematic biases that affect your way of thinking about a problem. The paradigm you personally hold onto strongly affects your reaction to that problem. Eg. floods result from:

- Acts of God
- Lack of engineered control structures
- Poor settlement location
- Environmental mismanagement
- Changing climate

**Unnatural disasters paragidm**: devastation triggered by natural disasters stems from ecologically destructive practices and from putting ourselves in harm's way. Mant ecosystems have been frayed to the point where they are no longer resilient and able to withstand natural disturbances, setting the stage for unnatural disasters (those made more frequent and more severe due to human actions)

**New disaster response paradigm**: scale triggered global attention. Exposed (reinforced) degree of vulnerability in LDCs. Thousands of relief agencies exist. Reconstruction guidance is very important. The overall idea is to merge reconstruction with DRR and development.

Build Back Better has the following components:

- *UN Mantra* of sustainable redevelopment and invulnerable development
- Reducing vulnerable while rebuilding. BBB popularized in aftermath of 2004 tsunami
- Multiple vulnerabilities, including infrastructural, physical, economical, social, environmental, and preparedness. All captured in report, entitled "Key Propositions for Building Back Better" (Bill Clinton)

From this report, some very important points arise:

- Recognize that families and communities drive their own recovery
- Recovery processes must create the conditions for entrepreneurs to flourish
- Good recovery must leave communities safer by reducing risks and building resilience

Disasters are a window of opportunity. Disasters expose risks and vulnerabilities, create political will and money for rebuilding, and create desire to never experience disaster again. Post-disaster recovery includes learning about risks and vulnerabilities and avoids re-creating these

![Window of opportunity](https://i.imgur.com/pdbbVUB.png)

**Building Back Better**: approach to post-disaster recovery that reduces vulnerability to future disasters and builds community resilience to address physical, social, environmental, and economic vulnerabilities and shocks. Recovery within a BBB framework gives impacted communities the chance to reduce risk not only from the immediate hazard but from threatening hazards and conditions as well. *Vulnerability reduction to help build resilience*

BBB has gone far beyond Bill's report. Now part of global policy framework seen below:

![Development Agenda](https://i.imgur.com/G7jVkS6.png?2)

The Paris agreement has also been put together for climate. Sustainable Development Goals are also important to make progress in the Paris agreement.

*Build* in BBB does not necessary mean build infrastructure. It also means building livelihoods.

The typical approach to BBB involves the following steps:

1. Disaster occurs
2. Post-disaster damage assessment
3. Post-disaster vulnerability assessment
4. Decision making and reconstruction planning. What can or cannot be changed? Should laws be changed?
5. Reconstruction

BBB challenges and criticisms exist:

- *Build*: can we build our way to DRR? Build structures or resilience>
- *Build back*: sometimes, the best DRR involves not building back. Why wait for disaster to build resilience? Should building back occur if hazards change and intensify?
- *Better*: how do we define and understand better? Better is in the context of a changing CC future.. designing better can be time consuming

## March 28 Class

When considering the socioeconomic impacts, we need to consider them at multiple scales:

- individual
- community/region
- national
- international

At the *individual* scale, impacts include loss of income/livelihood. The ability to prepare and/or respond differs greatly between people - some people may not recover, others may find opportunities. AT the *community* scale, differences exist between communities and their resilience to adapt. Rural/remote and resource dependent communities are often more vulnerable. At the *national/international* scale, disasters can have lingering consequences for countries. Low-income, small countries and countries dependent on a small number of industries can be particularly vulnerable

- Long-run proximity impacts of disasters are not predetermined
- **Economic DRR**: at the*Individual-level*, insurance, social capital, education, emergency planning, and access to credit. At the *community level*, insurance, access to credit, access to national/international assistance. At the *national level*, monetary policy, access to credit, international assistance, and lenders of last resort (IMF1)

THere are also cultural impacts. Eg. Destruction of historically and/or spiritually important places can have ripple effects for local economies. Hazards to the environment can create more problems. Additionally, the intersection between cultural/spiritual and the environment is an issue seen with First Nations. Eg. permafrost thaw. DRR depends on the circumstance.

International consequences of disasters: major disasters have ripple effects throughout whole regions and globally. Global implications include displaced people, supply-chain disruption, economic ripple effects (failure of major companies or financial institution, commodity price spikes)

- Impacts vary spatially and temporally
- Remember that biologic hazards are often not accounted for in rankings of hazard health impacts
- Accurately measuring the health impacts of some hazards, such as heat, is very difficult

Disasters cause both direct and indirect health impacts. *Direct health impact*: drowning in a flood, heat stroke, injury from earthquake building collapse. *Indirect*: exposure to elements due to loss of shelter, not having access to medicine or medical treatment.

*Vulnerability*: often, the most vulnerable are the most impacted. Remember: vulnerability can be influenced by factors that can be physical/biological AND/OR social/cultural/economic. Vulnerability factors are intersecting - it can be fluid, such as age.

*Health systems*: the people, places, policies, and programs that work together to keep people healthy. These are impacted directly (eg. gets flooded) or indirectly (hospital can't access supplies and must respond to an increased number of patients)

### Case Study: Extreme Heat and Vulnerability

Common characteristics of dangerous extreme heat events include:

- prolonged period of heat beyond what is "normal" in a given region
- heat at night
- extreme heat events that area early (April/May) or late (September) more dangerous
- Extreme heat in areas that are unfamiliar with it
- Both societal experience and physiological acclimatization play a role in determining the impacts of extreme heat

People at risk include: older adults, infants, young children, people living with chronic illness. people living alone, people living with mental illness, those experiencing low socioeconomic status, and those who work outside

Extreme Heat: Europe 2003. During this time, there were 35000-50000 deaths due to the record temperatures. At that point, it was the hottest in 500 years (at that point). It included 8 countries; in France, there were 15000 deaths. Here, there was little tradition of A/C. The apartment build was not very accomodating to heat flow. Additionally, the timing was critical, as it happened during "vacation month". This resulted in staff shortages in care facilities, families not checking on elderly, and physicians on holidays

- inequity due to redlining has led to disproportional exposure to hazards. Additionally, aiir conditioning requires money and costs CO2 emissions

Western North America Heat Domr (2021) led to unprecedented high temperatures in BC (greater than 50C). This lasted from June 25-July 1. Altogether, some roads melted, public transit had to stop operating, extreme stress on electricity system, and overwhelmed health system and heat related deaths. This caused 740 excess deaths in BC alone. Deadly weather-related disaster in Canadian history.. about 96% of deaths occurring in a residence with older adults. Urban greening is an obvious solution.

HARS (heat alarm response system): continuous process of prevention, preparation, response, evaluation, and adaptation. Often led by Public Health in cooperation with many community partners. May feed into general emergency planning.

In heat, there is high research needs and opportunities for innovation. Low or no carbon affordable cooling technologies are available. More knowledge on indoor heat risks and human health, innovative methods for planning and responding to extreme heat, and greater awareness of heat as a serious issue
