# Hydrology

## Week 1 - Intro to Water Resource Engineering

- Water is essential for life
- Fresh potable water is rare
- Periods of too much and too little water can result from natural and anthropogenic causes
  - Naturally, availability varies widely
  - Humans interrupt water movement
- Water resource engineers perform a number of essential services
- Hydrology is the science that encompasses the distribution, movement, and properties of water on our planet

**Precipitation**: ... definitions add

- Climate change is real and it affects water resource engineering
  - Temperature and CO2 are higher than they've been in millions of years
  - Canada's warming rate is twice the global mean
  - 1ºC increase, a 100 year event might occur every 20 years. With a 3ºC increase, extreme events will occur in greater frequency
- What does climate change mean for water resource engineering
  1. Increases uncertainty of our predictions
  2. Local changes precipitation - less snowmelt, more and more powerful convective storms
  3. Design should consider impact on carbon dioxide
- We define watersheds based on topography to help keep track of water on and under the ground
  - A **watershed** is the area enclosed by a topographic divide such that surface runoff drains by gravity

In Southern Ontario, watersheds are managed by conservation authorities. They are mandated to ensure the conservation, restoration, and responsible management of Ontario's water, land and natural habitats through programs that balance human, environmental, and economic needs

### Water Balance

Inflows (I)

- P: precipitation
- $G_{in}$: groundwater in

Outflows (O)

- ET: evapotranspiration
- D: diversions from lake
- Q: runoff from watersheds draining directly into lake
- $G_{out}$: groundwater out

$$\frac{\Delta{S}}{\Delta{t}}=I-O\tag{Water Balance}$$

$$\frac{\Delta{S}}{\Delta{t}}=(P+G_{in})-(Q+ET+G_{out})$$

Finding P is easy (rain gauges). Finding Q is easy (pressure gauges). G is hard (tracers). ET is hard (evaporation pans).

Water budgets are performed on different time scales. Each decade, assessment of urban water use - will we need another reservoir? Annually, assessment of irrigation needs - should we add a pump? Monthly, assessment of dam operations - when should we open/close the gates? Daily, assessment of flood forecasting - when will the river crest? Hourly, assessment of storm water management - how big should the pipe be?

Performing an annual water budget is a common first step in hydrologic studies

How to estimate net basin supply? There are 2 options. The first is the component method

**Component method**: calculate NBS by estimating P, E, and Q for the watershed

- P: need distribution of gauges, including on the lakes (hard)
- E: need to estimate evaporation from the whole lake (hard)
- Q: need to measure all the inflows, but some rivers are ungauged, so tricky

**Residual Method**: see image below
