## Sociotechnical Systems

**Technology**: simply a set of tools to control and adapt the environment, and knowledge of how to use them

**Sociotechnical system**: includes artifacts, people, institutions, conventions, laws.. all are connected in multiple and complex ways

- sociotechnical accounts include social aspects of design and adoption
- consider the flyswatter soppelsa and rodgers
  - fly killer patented by montgomery
  - incorporated into health campaign
  - entrenched in popular culture and propaganda
  - mass-produced in 30s
  - Therefore, flyswatter was socially constructed
  - Produced both flyswatter and flyswatting

Discussion: how was the smartphone socially constructed

## Technological Determinism

### Models of tech

- tech studies focus on the nature of technology and its development over time

Until recently, the default view of tech development had assumptions including:

- **Autonomy**: artifacts are largely separate from other elements and resist their influence
- **Rationality**: it develops according to an inherent, scientific logic, a logic that may be superior to the logics of politics or culture
- **Dominance**: it profoundly affects other social elements

There areas view tech history as one of predictable invention, dissemination, and replacement

### Ladder of progress

- technology development was viewed as a deterministic progression through a series of steps or ages
  - stone age -> bronze age -> iron age -> steam age -> information age
- this theory exhibits determinism. **Automony**: technologies are about the same regardless of the particular culture in which they occur. **Rationality**: there is a linear ordering of technologies not affected by particular political or cultural circumstances. **Dominance**: how people live in a culture is determined by their technological level

### Critiques of deterministic view

- fails to account for differences in development across places and cultures
- acknowledges impact of material technology on culture but not the reverse. Eg. flyswatter
- promotes a chauvinistic picture of European supremacy

## Radical Constructivism

### Social constructivism

Constructivists rejected determinism and emphasized *contingency* (tech development can turn out in different ways

Explanations of technology history exhibit

- contextuality: technology is a contingent combination of artifacts, practices, and institutions
- symmetry: all aspects of technology exhibit similar and interrelated development. Contrasts rationality, which suggests better technology. This is like fashion
- neutrality: artifacts are no more or less central to technology than other elements

2 forms of social constructivism: radical and moderate

### Radical Overview

- treat all sociotechnical elements equally
- completely believe social constructivism and reject determinism
- people, artifacts, institutions are all agents or *actants*. Everyone is equal, not more special due to their artifacts
- all elements lack intrinsic significance but gain it from their sociotechnical system
- resist generalization, prediction, or evaluation

**Speed bumps**: have certain physical characteristics but also

- a social role akin to police
- moral role urging people to behave in legal way

Speed bump is due to its particular situation. How do speed bumps exhibit contextuality, symmetry, and neutrality?

### Critiques of radical constructivism

- different actants have different, intrinsic qualities
  - eg. police and speed bumps are different in important ways
  - intrinsic qualities can anchor sociotechnical systems
- it may be possible to generalize across accounts of different technologies
  - there are general patterns, though not laws, of technological change
- it is possible to evaluate technologies
  - especially for setting social policy, such as distinguishing good choices in tech development. Seatbelts

## Social shaping (moderate constructivism)

- moderate constructivism sits in between
  - contextuality: technology is a contingent combination of artifacts, practices, institutions
  - progress: technological development exhibits trends (eg. conservatism) according to social momentum
  - semi-neutrality: artifacts can be more or less influential than other elements

Electrical grid

- cause and an effect. While it can be shaped by society, as tech gets larger and more complex, it moreso shapes society
- big systems look more deterministic, smaller ones more contingent

News Article

Transit commuters may not return

- bus and rail ridership more sensitive to economic changes than other modes. Financial effects to be felt long time
- remote working, driving, biking
- service cuts may prevail, lowering ridership
- us decline since 2014 because of cheap gas, easy credit, deteriorating infrastructure, uber and lyft
- lower-income switches to car are greater than discretionary riders (rail) increase
- essential workers prove that transit is essential. Perhaps more federal funding will come instead of fare reliance
- traffic hoped to beat traffic, fight climate change, and revitalize communities. However, it provides for those without. Transit rise as social service

## Michael Foucault

Michael was a homosexual thinker about energy. He adopted a historicographical method, and viewed things as the product of their history. **Problemization**: accumulation of social tensions, which show how social norms are thrown into relief. Unpredictable changes may occur, as well as accepted beliefs are disputed. The development of electricity is a problemization. **Problemize**: dispute

Constructivism: his genealogical method is radical social constructivist

- contextuality: emphasizes historical contingency
- symmetry: nothing special about the history of technology
- neutrality: technical and social elements shape each other
- avoided making general, moral evaluations

### Biopower

Sovereinty: *governmentality* is the set of procedures, analyses and knowledges, techniques, and institutions developed in modern western europe. In pre-modern times, government was based on sovereignty. This exercise a negative control over life. At most, the sovereign owes subjects defense from invaders. Subjects owe the sovereign their allegiance. Sovereignty was undermined in modern thought by ideas of equality, intercontinental commerce, science and technology. Governmentality adopted these ideas to the coordination and regulation of large social groups. It includes positive responsibilities: sovereign was strong and rich if towns thrived, but were governed to offset the risks they harboured.

Biopower is governmentality at the scale of whole populations. Populations are optimized by being analyzed scientifically, supported with education, health care, police, and defended by marginalizing abnormal groups. This ensured a productive society. However, how does food provision to cities constitute biopower?

Discipline analyzes and regularizes populations. Discipline organizes an analytical space. Discipline can also be cognitive: in school, students are taught rationale for the social order. Their own sense of rationality will prompt them to uphold it. In Paris, streets were changed to allow for military flow.

Energopower: in biopower, evolutionary biology was influential of development. After all, life is a struggle for existence. Energy physics influenced development of energypower: a form of governmentality based on identifying, regulating, and optimizing expenditures of energy. The industrial revolution was a key event, as power used to be generated/applied locally, but it could be transmitted through a network.

Daggett argued that while biopower focussed on life, energopower focussed on work. It is applied to human labour, coordination of human and machine, and automated machines. It is extendable to any coordinated activity. Discipline is applied not only to production but also to consumption. We use electricity for consumption and production

Energopower brings new concepts of energy and fuel. Before revolution, energy is detached from animals disposition to exertions. And was abstracted to anything transmissible to do work. Fuel is the thing transmitted for energy: mined, refined, and shipped. Energy was decoupled from work. As biopower works to separate good from bad, energypower separates work from waste. Anything that is nonproductive is seen as waste. Slothfulness is seen as personal failing (depression), and thus those people are also waste.

Energypower and biopower may conflict. Where productivity trumps human well-being, anthropocene: the project to put all the energy on Earth to work. By making electricity as efficient and expensive as possible, it does not benefit humans. Is this a progress trap?
