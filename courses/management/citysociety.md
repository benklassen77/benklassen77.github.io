## Sociotechnical Systems

**Technology**: simply a set of tools to control and adapt the environment, and knowledge of how to use them

**Sociotechnical system**: includes artifacts, people, institutions, conventions, laws.. all are connected in multiple and complex ways

- sociotechnical accounts include social aspects of design and adoption
- consider the flyswatter soppelsa and rodgers
  - fly killer patented by montgomery
  - incorporated into health campaign
  - entrenched in popular culture and propaganda
  - mass-produced in 30s
  - Therefore, flyswatter was socially constructed
  - Produced both flyswatter and flyswatting

Discussion: how was the smartphone socially constructed

## Technological Determinism

### Models of tech

- tech studies focus on the nature of technology and its development over time

Until recently, the default view of tech development had assumptions including:

- **Autonomy**: artifacts are largely separate from other elements and resist their influence
- **Rationality**: it develops according to an inherent, scientific logic, a logic that may be superior to the logics of politics or culture
- **Dominance**: it profoundly affects other social elements

There areas view tech history as one of predictable invention, dissemination, and replacement

### Ladder of progress

- technology development was viewed as a deterministic progression through a series of steps or ages
  - stone age -> bronze age -> iron age -> steam age -> information age
- this theory exhibits determinism. **Automony**: technologies are about the same regardless of the particular culture in which they occur. **Rationality**: there is a linear ordering of technologies not affected by particular political or cultural circumstances. **Dominance**: how people live in a culture is determined by their technological level

### Critiques of deterministic view

- fails to account for differences in development across places and cultures
- acknowledges impact of material technology on culture but not the reverse. Eg. flyswatter
- promotes a chauvinistic picture of European supremacy

## Radical Constructivism

### Social constructivism

Constructivists rejected determinism and emphasized *contingency* (tech development can turn out in different ways

Explanations of technology history exhibit

- contextuality: technology is a contingent combination of artifacts, practices, and institutions
- symmetry: all aspects of technology exhibit similar and interrelated development. Contrasts rationality, which suggests better technology. This is like fashion
- neutrality: artifacts are no more or less central to technology than other elements

2 forms of social constructivism: radical and moderate

### Radical Overview

- treat all sociotechnical elements equally
- completely believe social constructivism and reject determinism
- people, artifacts, institutions are all agents or *actants*. Everyone is equal, not more special due to their artifacts
- all elements lack intrinsic significance but gain it from their sociotechnical system
- resist generalization, prediction, or evaluation

**Speed bumps**: have certain physical characteristics but also

- a social role akin to police
- moral role urging people to behave in legal way

Speed bump is due to its particular situation. How do speed bumps exhibit contextuality, symmetry, and neutrality?

### Critiques of radical constructivism

- different actants have different, intrinsic qualities
  - eg. police and speed bumps are different in important ways
  - intrinsic qualities can anchor sociotechnical systems
- it may be possible to generalize across accounts of different technologies
  - there are general patterns, though not laws, of technological change
- it is possible to evaluate technologies
  - especially for setting social policy, such as distinguishing good choices in tech development. Seatbelts

## Social shaping (moderate constructivism)

- moderate constructivism sits in between
  - contextuality: technology is a contingent combination of artifacts, practices, institutions
  - progress: technological development exhibits trends (eg. conservatism) according to social momentum
  - semi-neutrality: artifacts can be more or less influential than other elements

Electrical grid

- cause and an effect. While it can be shaped by society, as tech gets larger and more complex, it moreso shapes society
- big systems look more deterministic, smaller ones more contingent
