## Unit 1

**Project Management**: the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the application and integration of the project management processes of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and  controlling, and closing. The project manager is the person responsible for accomplishing the project objectives. Project manager ensures these happen

A **project** is not a normal production.. it is temporary and of a finite duration. It also has progressive elaboration.

A **successful project** (iron triangle) meets scope, is at the cost planned for, by the time it was planned to be completed by.

The project management body of knowledge **PMBOK** contains a set of skills and knowledge developed by the project management institute (PMI). It is the basis for PMP certification, the most popular methodology which focusses on project processes

## Unit 2 - Leadership and Project Management

Statistics

- 46.9% of projects meet goals
- 33% of projects always or often on time and on budget
- 66% of projects give sufficient resources
- Over 50% say the wrong people lead projects

Qualities of a successful project manager

- Communication with stakeholders
- Risk assessment
- Scheduling and controlling
- Coaching team members
- Collaboration
- Leadership

Scientific Management

- first discussions of management written by Frederick Winslow Taylor (1911) and Charles Babbage (1835)
- argued that there should be a division between the planning and execution of work
- level of skill required as low as possible. Cheaper to employ certain people, and the origin of theory of modern management

> "Under this system, the operative was regarded as a person of a very low intellectual and educational level, a waster with an innate tendency towards low output, needing regular pacing to overcome habitual apathy, and requiring close supervision, but capable of positive motivation through payment by results"

- assumes that most people don't want to work

An opposite view is the human relations school

- arose in 1940s
- assumes most people rewarded by being able to do good work
- jobs designed to improve motivation and performance
- *Taylorism* leads to dissatisfaction and lower levels of performance
- McGregor developed Theory X and Theory Y Management in 1957, which helps to identify the type of approach that is being used in an organization

![Theories](https://i.imgur.com/7j3vZWZ.png)

- Theory X assumes naturally lazy, unable to do job properly without strong supervision
- Theory Y assumes people want to do a good job, and that a rewarding career motivates people

PMI Code of ethics

![Code of Ethics](http://www.simpleimageresizer.com/_uploads/photos/924493ce/Screen_Shot_2020-09-27_at_8.55.14_PM_1_76.png)

- **Responsibility**: take responsibility for the project and your commitments
- **Respect**: for the clients, stakeholders, and the project team
- **Fairness**: being fair
- **Honesty**: being honest

## Unit 3 - Starting a Project

- We need to know who the stakeholders are, how they influence the project, and how they see the project
- We need to understand the willingness of senior management and government stakeholders to provide resources
- We need to understand how stakeholders view results.. whether they understand the project intent or support the intent
- There is potential here for misunderstanding about intent or monies required

All stakeholders should participate in the project process, have effective communication, or overcome or neutralize any objections they may have

To identify stakeholders:

- talk to people who are involved in the project

Stakeholder roles: see below

![Roles](https://i.imgur.com/N4niaGj.png?1)

Agreeing on a problem is also important

- why is the project being conducted
- what problem is it intended to solve
- facilitation techniques help everyone agree on the problem

Resource Commitment

- no resources, no successes
- resources may come from a combination of sources
  - budget (senior administration)
  - different depardments (expertise and people)
- part of the process is to build support

Clarifying Expectations (Scope Definition)

- define project outcomes
- can be affected by the different desires of each stakeholder
- resolving issues and creating a common agreement on what the project is going to do is important
- senior management may need to intervene

Steps to Start a Project

1. Identify the Sponsor
   - has control over resources; senior level member that can communicate with the senior management team
2. Identify Key Stakeholders
   - have an interest in the project
   - can make the project a success or a failure
3. Prepare a questionnaire
   - questions to ask eash stakeholder
   - level of interest, commitment or opposition to the project
4. Conduct Interviews with Stakeholders
5. Identify and resolve problems
   - find conflicts with the project expectations
   - find weaknesses in the commitment to resources
   - resolve issues

Responsibilities

- need to be sorted out at the start of a project
- project manager allocates responsibilities
- if the project manager is unable to do this, they must go to the project sponsor

## Unit 4 - Organizational Structure

### Functional Organization

- project manager has the least power
- departments are separate
- very traditional
- PM depends on other departments
- PM may report to functional manager. Known as team leader, not project manager
- PM part time likely

Pros

- ideal for organizations w/ recurring projects
- everyone knows who's in charge
- the department has authority and responsibility for the project

Cons

- PM has little power and project authority
- PM is known as someone who oversees, but doesn't instruct anyone

### Weak Matrix

- employees work for departments but can be assigned projects across the organization
- report to both PM and manager of department
- can lead to confusion over allocation of that person's time
- PM has limited authority
- project team is part time
- project coordinator or team leader

Pros

- PM has little authority (departments have some responsibility for ensuring project success)

Cons

- project part of functional department's activities
- project team resources can be allocated between too many projects at once

### Balanced Matrix

- PM has more time, power, and reasonable level of authority
- project team members are usually part-time
- PM is full-time
- part-time administrative staff

Pros

- PM has balanced project authority with management
- more efficient use of functional resources

Cons

- conflict between organizational departments
- may battle for project team's time
- project team may feel they report to multiple bosses

### Strong Matrix Organization

- PM has stronger role than functional managers
- power to command time from resources
- reasonable to high level of power
- part-time to nearly full-time project team
- full-time PM and full-tume administrative staff

Pros

- project team may be assigned to a project from 50-90\% of its duration

Cons

- competition over resources
- costs may increase bc administrative staff allocated to individual projects rather than department

### Projectized Structure

- PM has the most power
- organization is structured around projects
- PM has higher level of responsibility
- high to complete authority over project team
- high to complete authority over project team
- works full time on project
- full time administrative staff

Pros

- PM has decision making authority
- no need to negotiate w/ functional managers

Cons

- project teams may compete for resources
- team may lose focus towards end of project

### Composite Organizations

- common in real world
- few follow organizational structures precisely

Project Management Office (PMO)

- more prevalent in organizations that take on a lot of projects
- typically:
	- select and supervise operation
	- provide software training
	- train and mentor PMs
	- select a project management methodology
	- provide guidance and templates for project teams
	- provide backup administrative help
	- take an overview of projects
	- allocate additional resources as needed

Key PM skills

- leads a project team
- communicates project info
- negotiates project terms and conditions
- active problem solver
- influences organization
