<p>Systems fit in the civil engineering body of knowledge. Becoming and being recognized as a professional civil engineer requires both a basic technical education and a broader education acquired through experience and lifelong continuous learning</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FqAicJV.png?1" alt="Body of Knowledge"></p>
<ul>
<li>systems under technical knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of civil engineering systems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>infrastructure</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>structural</li>
<li>water and wastewater</li>
</ul>
<p>Less obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>construction project management systems</li>
<li>building systems</li>
<li>cloud-based systems</li>
<li>supply chains</li>
<li>design work flow management</li>
</ul>
<p>Three objectives of a sustainable system: economic, environmental, social. Often have conflict. For example, water needs to meet people's demands, budget, and environmental standards. Thus, the purpose of a system is to serve the community in a sustainable fashion. Stella is an example system dynamics modelling tool</p>
<p>A <strong>system</strong> is something that transports inputs into outputs. It is a flow of material, energy, and information. Example: respiratory system, highway system, gear, ants in a colony, biodiversity in ecosystem; control system, information, mechanical systems, management systems; biological systems, banking systems, socio-economic systems, political systems</p>
<p>A <strong>system</strong> is an assemblage of parts united into an organized whole. It typically has a purpose, and is made of components, networks, subsystems, inputs, outputs, environmental forces, and a boundary. Anything within the boundry is part of whole system. Anything outside is environmental forces</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: operating parts of a system consisting of input, process and output</li>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: the properties or discernible manifestations of the components of a system. They characterize the system</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: the links between components and attributes. They connect systems and subsystems</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XEg51Pb.png?1" alt="Elements of a system"></p>
<p>A <strong>subsystem</strong> is a a component in a given system that can be broken down into smaller components that work together in order to achieve a purpose. Systems are evaluated on effectiveness by their intended purpose and desired outputs</p>

<h3 id="classification-of-systems">Classification of systems</h3>
<ol>
<li>Natural and human-made systems
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural</strong> are those naturally occurring</li>
<li><strong>Human-made</strong> systems are those that humans have intervened with components, attributes, or relationships</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical and conceptual systems
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical</strong> are those that manifest themselves in physical forms. They are constructed with physical components and occupy spaces</li>
<li><strong>Conceptual</strong> are those in which symbols represent the attributes of components. Ideas, plans, concepts, computer programs and hypotheses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Static and dynamic systems
<ul>
<li><strong>Static</strong> are those having structure without activity</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> are those that combine structural components with activity (eg. school)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closed and Open system
<ul>
<li><strong>Closed</strong>: do not interact significantly with their environment. Output isolated from input</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong> feedback system allow matters to cross in both directions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Composed of components, attributes and relationships</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K1nK4XP.png?1" alt="2nd methodology"></p>
<p>System design principles</p>
<ol>
<li>Systems design is an iterative process that evolves the design from a simple initial abstract representation to a detailed design that is implemented or communicated.</li>
<li>Design starts with a need, from which the conflicting objectives, scope, constraints, and criteria evolve, as well as the quantitative definitions of the design problem.</li>
<li>Many solutions should be generated and an intuitive and emotional leap to an immediate solution should be avoided.</li>
<li>Solutions are analyzed for feasibility</li>
<li>It is usually worth optimizing one or more solutions, and this will often require very formal and rigorous modeling and analysis</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NB0Qexn.png?1" alt="Organizational paradigms"></p>

<li>star-connected single hop planning, design</li>
<li>two-tiered hierarchal cluster hub and spoke system for air transportation</li>
<li>multi-hop mesh structural health sensors on a bridge</li>

<p><strong>Complex systems</strong> are systems whose behaviour is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are complex have distinct properties that arise from these relationships. Eg. nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, feedback loops. Some complex systems are intelligent transportation systems, mega-projects, supply chains and networks, andcommodities (steel, cement etc.) price fluctuations and their impact on project and asset management risk. As a result of interdependance, mechanisms that are subjected to positive, reinforcing feedback loops, which cause fat tails. They prevent the working of the central limit theorum where extreme limits on the bell curve are fatter. Extreme events happen more often. In general, complex systems have a great degree of interdependence, both temporal (variable depends on its past changes), horizontal (variables depend on one another), and diagonal (variable A depends on the past history of variable B). Problems from complex systems include sudden paralyzing traffic jams w/ complex road system, radical price fluctuations w/ complex governments, andcollapsing markets w/ complex market</p>

<h2 id="decision-theory">Decision Theory</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-decisions">Types of decisions</h3>
<p>Engineering decisions are as objective as possible. This is different than real, human life.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions under certainty</strong> have only one possible outcome for each action and this outcome is sure to occur. The decision is made to choose the action that will result in the most desirable outcome (cost or time)</p>
<p><strong>Decisions under probabilistic uncertainty</strong>: there are several outcomes for each action depending on the state of nature. These states happen with known probabilities. In this category, the outcomes are uncertain but the probabilities associated with these outcomes are known precisely</p>
<p><strong>Decisions under probabilistic imprecision</strong>: there are several outcomes for each action depending on the state of nature. These states happen with unknown or imprecise probabilities. In this category, the outcomes are uncertain and the probabilities associated with these outcomes are not known precisely</p>
<p><strong>Decisions under information imperfection</strong>: there are several outcomes for each action depending on the state of nature. These states happen with imperfect possibilities. In this category, the outcomes are uncertain and the probabilities associated with these outcomes are not known precisely</p>
<p><strong>Decisions under conflict and cooperation</strong>: there is more than a single decision maker. The objectives of different decision makers may differ and may not be known to other decision makers (game theory and negotiation and nash equilibrium)</p>
<p><strong>Decisions under risk</strong>: each action results in one of the outcomes with a known probability. The probabilities are assumed to be known to decision makers. The impacts of the outcomes are also assumed to be known</p>
<p><strong>Decision Matrix</strong>: put alternatives in left hand column, states of nature on top</p>
<p>Decision theory is based on 3 basic concepts: alternative, outcome, and state of nature. <strong>Alternatives</strong> can be open and new alternatives can be invented or discovered. However, they are assumed to be <strong>closed</strong> in decision theory. There's 2 types of closed sets: alternatives with voluntary closure (dicision maker closes set) and alternatives with involuntary closure (closure imposed on decision maker). Alternatives are mutually exclusive <strong>Outcomes</strong> are defined as an effect of choosing an alternative and the state of nature experienced. <strong>States of nature</strong> are defined as the various unknown factores that can affect decisions. For example, deciding to wear a raincoat is dependent on whether it rains or not.</p>
<h2 id="expected-utility">Expected Utility</h2>
<p><strong>Utility Function</strong>: visualizes expected utility to demonstrate how people will make decisions</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L99sjly.png?1" alt="Utility Function"></p>
<p>Above, <em>A</em> depicts logical behaviour, <em>B</em> depicts someone careful about debt, <em>C</em> depicts a risk taker, <em>D</em> depicts declining marginal utility of money to the decision maker as more and more needs are met, and <em>E</em> illustrates typical human behaviour when making investment decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Utility Theory</strong> is commonly used when probabilities of the states of nature are known and well-defined. <span class="katex-error" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected &#x27;}&#x27;, got &#x27;EOF&#x27; at end of input: …imes{p_2)+\dots" style="color:#cc0000">\textrm{EU}=(u_1\times{p_1})+(u_2\times{p_2)+\dots</span></p>
<ol>
<li>For each alternative, a weighted average of the utility values under different states of nature is assigned</li>
<li>The probabilities of these states are used to weight these averages</li>
<li>Then the expected utility theory selects an action that maximizes the expected value of the resulting utility</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/y0Nkwrv.png?1" alt="Expected Utility Example"></p>
<h2 id="decision-trees">Decision Trees</h2>
<p>Decision Tree Procedure (<a href="https://benklassen77.github.io/documents/courses/management/systems/decisiontreeexample.pdf">Example</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw out tree of possibilities</li>
<li>Draw out tree with numbers</li>
<li>Calculate expected utility</li>
<li>Highlight pathway of best value path</li>
</ol>

The first node is known as the marginal probability (prior) - eg. add. The second node is known as conditional probability (posterior). See below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eo6sd3R.png?1" alt="Sequence of events"></p>
<p><strong>Marginal Probability</strong>: probability of one event, regardless of the other event</p>
<p><strong>Conditional Probability</strong>: probability of A given the occurrence of B. Eg. probability of state of nature given test results</p>
<p>There are 5 steps to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine states of nature given utilities (conditional probability)</li>
<li>Determine action based on utility</li>
<li>Determine experimental results (marginal probability)</li>
<li>Make decision</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expected Monetary Value (EMVI)</strong> = EV w/o info - (EV w/ info - Cost of info). EMVI = 250000 - (257618-10000) = 2382. Therefore, low value</p>
<p><strong>Expected Monetary Value of Perfect Information (EMVPI)</strong>: result and state of nature are the same. Thus, this has higher value. Sometimes, this is free. Real-time forecast,</p>
<p>Cost of EMVPI = (optimal action cost w/o info) - (optimal action w/ perfect)</p>
