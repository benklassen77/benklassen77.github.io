# Law and ethics

## Introduction

Law is a *federalist system*: 3 branches, with federal and provincial courts. It is a *common law system (except for Quebec, which is civil law system)*. Common law countries have case law as primary importance, whereas in civil law systems, statutes predominate. *Adversarial system*: people have advocates on their behalf

In Canada, the British North America Act, or *Constitution Act, 1867*, placed Canada under its own control. It established federal government (House of Commons, Senate), Provincial governments, and supreme court of Canada.

Further to this, the *1982 Constitution Act or Charter*, established individual rights and fundamental freedoms, such as:

- Freedom of conscience and religion
- Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication
- Freedom of peaceful assembly
- Freedom of association

There's also democratic rights (right to vote), mobility rights (right to move), and legal rights

**Public law**: criminal offences; licences, approvals, taxation, immigration; multi-levels of government like GHG regulation; legal rules from legislation and some case law

**Private law**: concerns obligations and dealings between non-government parties; transfer of property, sales; legal rules derived from case law and some legislation

**Legislation**: federal and provincial acts and regulations, bylaws

**Ancillary Sources of law**: orders, codes, guidelines

**Common Law**: case law

## Persons, Property, and Business Entities

**Person**: entity recognized by the law as separate and independent, with legal rights and existence. A person can have property in things, enter into contracts, sue others who harm them, be sued, use courts to enforce rights

**Property**: the combination of the legal rights of persons with respect to objects, and the obligations owed them by othres and guarranteed and protected by government. It is a bundle of rights for possession/exclusion, mortgage/use as security, lease/license, sell/dispossess, encumber.

Property rights are limited by:

- *Tort Law* non-voluntary obligations, such as nuisance
- *Contract* voluntary obligation, such as lease
- *Criminal/regulatory law*, such as planning/zoning and by-laws

Real property includes freehold, leasehold, and license. Personal property includs chattels and equity. Intellectual property includes patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret.

- **Freehold property**: highest form of property ownership, or "biggest bundle of sticks". Owning the land and the building. Contract must be in real writing
- **Leasehold property**: right to occupy/exclude transferred from owner to tenant. No ownership interest. Contract must be in real writing
- **License**: contractual permission to do something
- **Equity/equitable interest**: a beneficial interest in the thing
- **Chattel**: an item of tangible movable or immovable property except real estate
- **Patents**: are created for the purtose of innovation. No patents in the absense of patent law. Patents last 20 years from date of applicaiton. Criteria includes patentable subject matter, something novel, something with utility, and something inventive (non-obvious)
- **Trademark**: sign or combination of signs used or proposed to be used by a person to distinguish their goods or services form those of another
- **Copyright**: having sole right to produce or reproduce a work
- **Trade secret**: valuable information including recipes

In Canada, corporations are required to follow the following:

- Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA) for federal corporations
- Ontairo Business Corporation Act (BCA) for provincial corporaiton

These set-out how corporations are established, how they are governed, and liabilities. Shareholders appoint corporate directors, who control the corporation. The corporation then contracts corporate officers and employees. In partnerships, two or more persons carry on business in common with intent to profit. Governed by a contract, not a separate person, and each partner is liable for partnership debts. LP or LLPs are special partnerships. A sole proprietorship has no separate personality, the individual assumes all risk of liability.

|Asset Purchase|Share Purchase|
|---|---|
|Contract|Contract|
|Property ownership is transferred|Equitable ownership is transferred|
|Indemnity|Indemnity|
|Liability of previous owner does not transfer with property|Liability of purchased corporation follows shares|

## Tort Law

A *tort* is a civil wrong, other than breach of contract, for which a remedy may be obtained, usually in the form of damages. If a tort has occurred, or is committed, someone is torted against. A tortfeaser is someone who commits a tort. It enforces negative rights - specifically, right to exclusion. For example, the right to be left alone. In contract, positive rights are the right to do something. Tort law comes from common law.

Torts are claims by a plaintiff against a defendant, and are decided by a trial conducted by a court unless settled. For claim to be successful, plaintiff must prove each element of the tort to establish liability, including elements of fault. Once liability established, remedy is damages. There are several forms of fault:

1. *Specific Intent*: intentional series of steps leading up to it
2. *General Intent*: intended to do it, but not the result
3. *Recklessness*: not considering consequences
4. *Wilful blindness*: turning blind eye
5. *Pure Causation (strict liability)*: caused something w/o being at fault
6. *Lack of diligence (negligence)*: not doing what a reasonable person would do

### Negligence

The element test for negligence is:

1. Duty of Care
2. Breach of Standard of Care
3. Causation
4. Damages

The test for duty of care is as follows (Ann's test):

1. Forseeability: could this cause harm? If so, *prima facie* duty of care. Are there considerations to negate or limit this duty of care?
   1. Was the defendant's action the result of a policy decision of a public body?
   2. Is the defendant protected by statute or the common law?
   3. Is the defendant exempted from liability by a 'good faith' clause in the statute
   4. Is the relationship betwee nthe parties so distant and tenuous, that liability isn't justified?
2. Is duty of care already recognized, or is it a new duty. If new, how close is the plaintiff to the defendent

The test for standard of care, for engineers, includes:

1. Forseeability: was this forseeable
2. Expectations: were the client expectations or promises from the engineer reasonable
3. Alternatives: were proper alternatives explored
4. Knowledge and Control: was the engineer competent

There are two tests that can be used for causation:

1. "But for" test. For example, *but for the road not being closed, would the crime have happenned?*
2. Material contribution test (rarely used). *Did the defendant contribute materially to the risk of injury*

Damages may be the difference in profit lost in the slow-season and busy season, as in Rivtow Lost profit is a pure economic loss and is generally not recoverable in tort; it is recoverable when caused by a failure to warn

### Private Nuisance

The test for private nuisance is as follows:

1. Unreasonable interference with land. Biggest key here
2. Is it an amenity nuisance or a physical harm
3. If amenity, does it impact use/enjoyment of property? If physical harm, how substantial?
4. Damages are then determined

### Strict Liability

For strict liability tort to be committed, the following must all be satisfied:

1. Made a non-natural use of land
2. Brought something dangerous onto the land
3. That dangerous thing escaped
4. The dangerous thing caused harm

For strict liability, there is no mention of fault anywhere!

### Trespass

For trespass, physical interference with another person's land or chattel must have occurred. It must be:

- Direct
- Intentional

Consent is an absolute defence, either express or implied. It is "actionable per se", such that proof of suffered damage is not required and nominal damages are awarded.

## Cases

### Introduction - Donoghue v Stevenson

#### Facts

- Mrs. Donoghue was drinking ginger beer with a snail, got sick, and sued Stevenson (manufacturer)
- Donoghue sued Stevenson

#### Issues

Was the manufacturer responsible for ensuring the safety of the customer?

#### Holding

Stevenson owed Donoghue a "duty of care"

#### Rationale

- There was sufficiently proximate relationship between consumers and manufacturers
- It was forseeable that failure to ensure the product's safety would lead to customer harm

### Property - Popov v Hayashi

#### Facts

- Popov received Barry Bond's ball into his glove
- A mob attacked him; Hayashi was able to take full possession

#### Issues

Did Popov have full possession? Who is entitled to the ball?

#### Holding

Popov and Hayashi have an equal and undivided interest in the ball

#### Rationale

Popov had a pre-possessory interest (significant, but incomplete steps to obtain full possession) in the ball, and Hayashi had full, complete possession of the ball.

#### Key Takeaways

- Abandonment requires intention to abandon and no owner
- There is a right to exclude others from your property, as Popov tried to exclude Hayashi
- Property without possession is pre-possessory interest
- There is an equitable ownership/interest at the end

### Person - Saloman v Saloman

#### Facts

- 20000+7 shares
- Saloman sold business to company that he owned
- To pay for business, company sent debentures
- When assets liquidated, Salomon paid first. Lenders not paid.

#### Issues

Why was Saloman entitled to the money? Shouldn't it be the lenders?

#### Holding

Saloman was allowed to keep the money, due to the debacheries

#### Rationale

Mr. Saloman was a different person than the company Saloman Ltd. He was just a shareholder

#### Key Takeaway

- Corposations are creations of statutes
- Corporations are separate legal persons
- Courts may disregard legal personality in cases of fraud
- Liability of Corporation is not the liability of its shareholders (owners)

### Duty of Care - Cooper v Hobart

#### Facts

- Mortgage broker Eron misused investment funds. Was ordered to lose license after some time
- Eron then went out of business
- Private investors lost money. Cooper sued Hobart, insurance regulator who took away Eron's license, to see if he owed a private law duty of care to investors from liability in negligence

#### Issues

Does regulator owe private law duty of care for alleged negligence in failing to oversee conduct of licensed company?

#### Holding

The regulator did not owe a private law duty of care

#### Rationale

By the Anns test, the regulator did not have a proximate relationship enough with the mortgage broker
 
#### Key Takeaway

- Duty of care when there is foreseeability of harm and sufficiently close relationship
- Duties of care can be established in courts
- Policy factors may override a duty of care

### Negligence Standard of Care - Ontario v CH2M

#### Facts

- MTO hired CH2M to do an environmental assessment on a lot for hydrocarbons to determine if remediation was required
- CH2M did an environmental assessment, and found the site to be OK - no remediation required
- MTO found contaminated soil - one firm recommended they remediate

#### Issues

3 issues:

1. Was CH2M's work below the standard of care and a breach of contract
2. Was the MTO remedial process reasonable?
3. Did the Ministry fail to mitgate damages?

#### Holding

1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Yes, except for not consulting CH2M

#### Rationale

1. Did not look at all documents. Less than the standard of care
2. Yes - consulted another engineering firm

#### Key Takeaway

- Engineers must complete work with reasonable diligence
  - Evidenced by expert evidence
  - Failure to do so is negligence and breach of contract
- Plaintiff has duty to mitigate damages

### Negligence Causation - Rivtow v Washington

#### Facts

- Washington designed a crane with a defect, nad distributed it through Walkem
- Both Ws knew about the defect but did not inform the buyers
- Someone died from a crane failure. Washington withdrew cranes during Rivtow's busy season

#### Issue

Was Washington responsible for the economic losses to Rivtow?

#### Holding

Yes, Washington is responsible for losses

#### Rationale

Although physical harm is normally required for economic loss recovery in negligence, here liability here is founded on knowledge of the danger which gave rise to a potential failure. Here, there was a duty fo warn: damages coming from trying to avoid a failure are forseeable.

#### Key Takeaways

- Duty of care can etend to duty to warn in a known risk
- Pure economic losses generally not recoverable in tort
- Economic losses may be recoverable when they are caused by a failure to warn or negligent advice
- There are proximal and remote damages that

### Strict liability and private nuisance - Smith v Inco

#### Facts

- Inco used nickel on their property, and released nickel oxide into the air
- This precipitated into people's property. Over time, very high levels
- Nickel wasn't necesaary harmful, but it gave a stigma and thus, property value decreased
- Ellen Smith represented class action suing for property value based on trespass, private nuisance, and strict liability

#### Issue

Was Inco responsible for property decrease in value?

#### Holding

No, strict liability and nuisance not applicable

#### Rationale

- Strict liability not applicable to contaminants that are the intended consequence of an approved activity and carried out in accordance with all rules and regulations. Thus, strict liability doesn't apply unless a non-natural use of land is carried out
- Nuisance requirees more than a mere chemical alteration in the content of the soil, such as physical harm. Not perceived issue

#### Key Takeaways

- How do we evaluate what constitutes a "non-natural  use* and an "escape"? Or when is something more than a "mere chemical alteration"
- In Canadian Tire v Huron Concrete, the concrete supplier had a gas tank that leaked gas onto Canadian Tire's property. Following Inco:
  - Failure of Huron to comply with laws and regulations rendered it's land use non-natural
  - Contamination exceeded health protection standards, and was thus more than a mere chemical alteration
  - Presence triggered provincial standards, and thus had a detrimental effect on land use rights
  - Based on expert witness, contamination was a human health risk
  - While initial migration of gasoline wasn't necessarily trespass, the free phase gasoline continued to be the personal property of the defendent after it had moved properties. The plaintiff had requested the defendent to remove the gasoline, which they failed to do. Thus, trespass
