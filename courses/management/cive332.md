# Systems and Project Management

## Intro

**Objective**: to begin to understand how to design and model systems and then how to use the models to manage and optimize system performance

## Systems Theory

- Where do systems fit in the civil engineering body of knowledge? Becoming and being recognized as a professional civil engineer requires both a basic technical education and a broader education acquired through experience and lifelong continuous learning

- systems under technical knowledge

Definitions of Systems

- infrastructure
- transportation
- structural
- water and wastewater

Less obvious:

- construction project management systems
- building systems
- cloud-based systems
- supply chains
- design work flow management

Three objectives of sustainable: economic, environmental, social. Often have conflict

- Stella is system dynamics modelling tool

A **system** is something that transports inputs into outputs. It is a flow

- eg. respiratory system, highway system, gear, ants in a colony, biodiversity in ecosystem
- control system, information, mechanical systems, management systems

A **system** is an assemblage of parts united into an organized whole. It typically has a purpose

Classification of systems:

1. Natural and human-made systems
   - **natural** are those naturally occurring
   - **Human-made** have been made by humans
2. Physical and conceptual systems
3. Static and dynamic systems
4. Closed and Open system
   - **closed**: do not interact significantly with their environment. Output isolated from input
   - **open** feedback system allow matters to cross in both directions

Composed of components, attributes and relationships

System design methodology

1. Systems design is an iterative process that evolves the design from a simple initial abstract representation to a detailed design that is implemented or communicated.
2. Design starts with a need, from which the conflicting objectives, scope, constraints, and criteria evolve, as well as the quantitative definitions of the design problem.
3. Many solutions should be generated and an intuitive and emotional leap to an immediate solution should be avoided.
4. Solutions are analyzed for feasibility
5. It is usually worth optimizing one or more solutions, and this will often require very formal and rigorous modeling and analysis
