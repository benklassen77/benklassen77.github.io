## Intro

**Objective**: to begin to understand how to design and model systems and then how to use the models to manage and optimize system performance

**Help**: piazza, online social meets. A1 Q2 Gene, A2 Q2 Aida, A3 Q3 Kareem, A4 Q4 Sina

## Systems Theory

- Where do systems fit in the civil engineering body of knowledge? Becoming and being recognized as a professional civil engineer requires both a basic technical education and a broader education acquired through experience and lifelong continuous learning

- systems under technical knowledge

Definitions of Systems

- infrastructure
- transportation
- structural
- water and wastewater

Less obvious:

- construction project management systems
- building systems
- cloud-based systems
- supply chains
- design work flow management

Three objectives of a sustainable system: economic, environmental, social. Often have conflict

- eg. water needs to meet people's demands, budget, and environmental standards
- Stella is an example system dynamics modelling tool

A **system** is something that transports inputs into outputs. It is a flow

- eg. respiratory system, highway system, gear, ants in a colony, biodiversity in ecosystem
- eg. control system, information, mechanical systems, management systems
- eg. biological systems, banking systems, socio-economic systems, political systems

A **system** is an assemblage of parts united into an organized whole. It typically has a purpose

- made of components, networks, subsystems, inputs, outputs, environmental forces, and a boundary
- anything within boundry is part of whole system. Anything outside is environmental forces
- **Components**: operating parts of a system consisting of input, process and output
- **Attributes**: the properties or discernible manifestations of the components of a system. They characterize the system
- **relationships**: the links between components and attributes. They connect systems and subsystems

### Systems and subsystems

- a component in a given system may also be broken down into smaller componetns that work together in order to achieve a purpose
  - this component is then also a system, called a **subsystem**
  - designation of system, subsystem, and components are relative

### Boundaries and environment

Score, limits or boundaries of the system must be clearly specified or defined

- everything that remains outside the boundaries is considered the environment
- systems are rarely isolated from their environments
- it is important to consider the influence of the environment on the system

### Classification of systems

1. Natural and human-made systems
   - **Natural** are those naturally occurring
   - **Human-made** systems are those that humans have intervened with components, attributes, or relationships
2. Physical and conceptual systems
   - **Physical system** are those that manifest themselves in physical forms. They are constructed with physical components and occupy spaces
   - **Conceptual system** are those in which symbols represent the attributes of components. Ideas, plans, concepts, computer programs and hypotheses
3. Static and dynamic systems
   - **static** are those having structure without activity
   - **dynamic** are those that combine structural components with activity (eg. school)
4. Closed and Open system
   - **closed**: do not interact significantly with their environment. Output isolated from input
   - **open** feedback system allow matters to cross in both directions

Composed of components, attributes and relationships

### 2 Methodologies

System design principles

1. Systems design is an iterative process that evolves the design from a simple initial abstract representation to a detailed design that is implemented or communicated.
2. Design starts with a need, from which the conflicting objectives, scope, constraints, and criteria evolve, as well as the quantitative definitions of the design problem.
3. Many solutions should be generated and an intuitive and emotional leap to an immediate solution should be avoided.
4. Solutions are analyzed for feasibility
5. It is usually worth optimizing one or more solutions, and this will often require very formal and rigorous modeling and analysis

See below for organizational paradigms

- Graphs showing networks
- Matrices
- Tables

![Organizational paradigms](https://i.imgur.com/NB0Qexn.png?1)

- star-connected single hop planning, design
- two-tiered hierarchal cluster hub and spoke system for air transportation
- multi-hop mesh structural health sensors on a bridge

**Complex systems** are systems whose behaviour is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are complex have distinct properties that arise from these relationships. Eg. nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, feedback loops

- intelligent transportation systems
- mega-projects
- supply chains and networks
- commodities (steel, cement etc.) price fluctuations and their impact on project and asset management risk
- As a result of interdependance, mechanisms that are subjected to positive, reinforcing feedback loops, which cause fat tails. They prevent the working of the central limit theorum where extreme limits on the bell curve are fatter. Extreme events happen more often

- sudden paralyzing traffic jams w/ complex road system
- radical price fluctuations w/ complex governments
- collapsing markets w/ complex market
