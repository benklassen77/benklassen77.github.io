- *v-movable*: -v is added to 3rd person plural when it is the last word in a sentence, or when the next word in the sentence is a vowel or diphthong
- Simple or continuous. Λεγο means both I speak and I am speaking
- Present infinitive removes reference to a particular person and implies continuity. Something is to be done always, continually.
- Voice of verb: action of the verb in relation to the subject of the sentence. The child loves God
- Aspect of action: whether something is completed, in progress or a simple event

Structure Words

- In continuous writing, Καί changes to καì
- ού becomes ούκ before word with vowel with smooth breathing mark. Becomes ούχ before word with rough breathing mark
- άλλά becomes άλλ´ (elision) when the following wors begins with a vowel. Typically happens before articles, pronouns and particles and rarely before nouns and verb

## Lesson 4

If verb stem ends in α, ε or ο after the removal of ω, it changes. For εω, ε+ω=ω, ε+ε=ει, and ε+ο=ου. All contracted forms in present indictative receive the circumflex accent over their contraction. See below:
