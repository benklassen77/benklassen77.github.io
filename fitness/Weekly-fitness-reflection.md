# Weekly Reflection

## Week 1

This week was not great. It was my last week of "freedom", with new years eve as well as family events taking place. I had my fair share of cookies, fine cheeses, meats, snacks, and chocolate while neglecting to workout. I only ended up working out once in the morning and did not not go to Corolla Park.

Suggestions to improve

1. Go to bed earlier
2. Drink tea and drink bubly instead of snacking
3. Get into the fitness routine

## Week 2

Week 2 was okay. I had three morning workouts, two evening workouts (ab and leg day), squash and tennis. It is regrettable that I missed the power workout since it was foggy on Friday. I was also really stressed on Friday, and ended up binge eating as well as eating biscottis, chips, and foods that I am allergic to. 

For the coming week, I have thought of a couple of changes.

1. God is most important. While I need to stick to my plan, I cannot do this at the expense of my relationship with the Father. 
2. I need to go to bed earlier so that I can surely get up at 5:15 am.
3. If I am really anxious, go for a walk and pray instead of binge eat.
