# Weekly Reflection

## Week 1

This week was not great. It was my last week of "freedom", with new years eve as well as family events taking place. I had my fair share of cookies, fine cheeses, meats, snacks, and chocolate while neglecting to workout. I only ended up working out once in the morning and did not not go to Corolla Park.

Suggestions to improve

1. Go to bed earlier
2. Drink tea and drink bubly instead of snacking
3. Get into the fitness routine
