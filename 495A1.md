# Assignment 1

## Question 1

Conifers are more desirable than deciduous trees because they are geotropic. In contrast, deciduous trees are phototropic. This makes conifers typically grow straighter than deciduous trees, which is better for sawn lumber. Deciduous trees are also often slow growers in North America, while conifers grow much quicker.

## Question 2

The hole in the middle of a wood cell is called a lumen. See Figure 1 below:

## Question 3

The moisture content of wood changes as boards season. When it decreases, it shrinks, and as it increases, it swells. This can result in twisting, or buckling, if there is not room enough for the board to expand. If it is connected to a connection that does not allow for torsion, radial or tangential shrinkage may result in torsion of the member away from the connection.
