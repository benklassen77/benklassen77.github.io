## Wall and Floor Framing

Primary objectives of good construction:

1. Structurally sound building
2. Capable of withstanding wind and floor loads. In some instances, shrinkage of lumber is a factor.

Framing considerations:

- must provide for heating, AC, plumbing, and electricity
- adequate support at partitions such as stairwells
