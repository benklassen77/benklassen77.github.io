# Sourdough

## Starter

BEFORE I can start, I need to buy

- 2 weck glass jar (#743, 3/4 liter jar)
- kitchen scale
- instant thermometer
- spatula
- rye flour
- unbleached, all-purpose white flour

Note: **mature starter** is when starter has risen to it's maximum height

### Making from scratch

Each day, the starter needs to be 'fed'. This is easily done according to the following steps:

1. Stir down your starter a little bit with spatula
2. Place clean jar onto scale and scoop required portion from the jar that was just stirred
3. Add fresh flour and water (80 ºF or 26 ºC), and mix well
4. Loosely cover the jar and leave to rest until next feeding

**Day 1**: add 100g whole grain rye flour and 150g water and mix until all dry bits incorporated. Let rest for 24 hrs

**Day 2**: add 75g of existing mixture and 50g rye flour, 50g all-purpose flour, and 125g water. Mix until all dry bits incorporated and leave for 24 hrs

**Day 3**: add 75g of mixture and 50g rye flour, 50g all-purpose flour, and 125g water. Mix until all dry bits incorporated and leave for 24 hrs

**Days 4-6**: add 75g of mixture with 50g rye flour, 50g of all-purpose flour and 125g water. Do the same 12 hrs later, and then do it again in the morning

**Day 7**: add 50g of mixture with 50g rye flour, 50g all-purpose flour, and 100g water. In the evening (12 hours-ish)

- Until the starter is very active (couple weeks), feed at least once a day

### Weekend baking maintanence

**Normal refreshment**: what you should normally do to refresh your starter

|Ingredient|Weight|
|----|----|
|Starter|20g|
|Flour|100g|
|Room Temperature Water|80g|

Below is the weekly schedule:

|Day|Action|
|----|----|
|Monday|Starter in fridge|
|Tuesday|Starter in fridge|
|Wednesday|Starter in fridge|
|Thursday|Refresh in evening|
|Friday|Refresh in morning and evening|
|Saturday|Build levain|
|Sunday|Bake loaves/pancakes|

**Thursday**: take starter out of fridge after work to warm up. Before going to bed, bring jar to 30g starter and add 100g room temp water and 100g flour (or normal refreshment flour mixture). Leave to ferment until morning

**Friday**: before work, discard starter until you're left with 15g. Refresh with normal refreshment flour mixture. Stir and leave on counter with loose-fitting lid. In evening, do a normal refresh

**Saturday**: In the morning, build levean from specific recipe. Leave levain to ferment during the day. Now, if you want to make pancakes for Sunday, refresh starter to prepare dough later. If you want to skip pancakes, refresh and leave for 30 min before putting it in the fridge

**Sunday**: make pancakes and bake bread

- let dough rest 30 min between sets
- last hour will not require folds

5. Divide & Preshape (5:15 Saturday)

   1. Lightly flour work surface
   2. Cut dough into 2 halves
   3. Lightly flour the hand without the bench knife. Using the knife and the hand, turn each dough half on the counter while pulling the dough towards you, forming a circle
   4. Let rest uncovered for 25 min

   3. Pull out the shallow side of the combo cooker, and using the parchment paper, place the loaf onto the shallow side. Then place the heavy side on top
   4. Turn the oven down to 475 ºF and bake for 20 min
