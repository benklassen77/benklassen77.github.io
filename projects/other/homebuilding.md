## Wall and Floor Framing

Primary objectives of good construction:

1. Structurally sound building
2. Capable of withstanding wind and floor loads. In some instances, shrinkage of lumber is a factor.

Framing considerations:

- must provide for heating, AC, plumbing, and electricity
- adequate support at partitions such as stairwells

Steps to building house:

1. Foundation
2. Framing
3. Electrical
4. Plumbing
5. Insulation and vapour barrier
6. Drywall

### History of framing

In mid-19th century, timber was abundant but it was hard to make it into lumber. Without sawmills, it was handcut. Thus, larger pieces were used, and since nails were expensive, mortise and tenon joints were used.

Today, with sawmills, the amount of wood used is reduced.

### Platform (western) framing

- floor system of joists created and covered with plywood sheets
- exterior walls and partitions are tilted up for easy assembly

Advantages

- platforms are safe to work on
- building walls in sections is easy
- each stud space blocked off by wall, and thus prevents fire
- adaptable to prefabrication

### Balloon framing

- long continuous studs between sill at foundation and top plate
- floor joists rest on a ribbon
  - ribbon is a piece of wood which rests inside cuts along the vertical studs

Advantage

- Since maximum shrinkage occurs across the grain (width) of the board, this minimizes shrinkage. This is because, in contrast to platform framing, the entire frame does not rest on joists along the bottom (Fig. 4-4 ATS)
  - However, since drywall has largely replaced lath and plaster for interior walls, shrinkage concern is of low importance, as plastered walls develop cracks when wood framework shrinks

### Plank and beam framing

- uses equally spaced posts
- spans greater distances than most subflooring
- roof boards visible

Advantage

- asthetic because of the visible wood

Disadvantages

- more material cost
- limitations for windows or doors due to equally spaced posts

### Components

There are multiple components involved. These include:

1. Sill
2. Girders
3. Beams
4. Columns
5. Posts
6. Framing joists
7. Flooring and bridging
8. Stud walls and partitions
9. Openings
10. Sheathing walls

#### Sill

The **sill** is 1st part of frame to be set into place and rests on foundation wall. Made with 2x4, 2x6 or 2x8.

- typically embedded in mortar
- anchor bolts placed along foundation wall
- box sill used for platform framing as stud on outside with joists running along length and plywood subfloor on top

**Rim Joist** is the sill and the header. The 2 headers run perpendicular to the joists running across

- joists run perpendicular to these headers. If there is a basement window, 2 joists required
