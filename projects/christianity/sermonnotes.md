## April 19 2020 - Scandalous 1

Maturity requires proximity

- relational element to model and love essential

> 1 Corinthians 4:18-21, "Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?

- your faith does not rise and fall on your ability to explain, interpret, bring clarity to, or have a perfect understanding of every authors intent or meaning. It is built on Jesus Christ!
- don't just think Bible said it. Engaged, wrestled, juxtaposed, interpreted

## April 26 2020 - Scandalous 2

> 1 Corinthians 5:5, "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles—that a man has his father’s wife! And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you. For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."

- The Jesus Community is an Imperfect Community
- Tolerance inside the church is empty faith
  - Sometimes, "get out" is the right response
  - Transformation requires crucial conversation
    - Opinions are varied, stakes are high, emotions are running strong

What does *hand this man over to Satan* mean?

- Bring person out of church so they can be brought back to their senses and be restored to community
- Reclamation and Restoration, not Obliteration and Damnation
  - Scandalous message of grace

## May 3 2020 - Scandalous 3

> 1 Corinthians 6, "If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people? Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church? I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of unbelievers! The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
People in Corinth struggling with old societal values

- Jesus way is countercultural
- Community of Jesus is restoration and reclamation
- At the time in Corinth, people would slander etc. in court and it was important to move up in the social ladder
  - Paul was strongly opposed to this
- Jesus is opposed to shame, and so to is the church. Unfortunately, many churches practice shaming
- Paul says to not go to court

Why would it say "why not rather be wronged"?

- Paul is not saying to not go to court or that justice shouldn't happen. he's saying why not seek wisdom and why are they not humble
- Losing is winning according to Jesus
- No scandal that is greater than God's scandalous grace. Jesus will mend your heart

### Enlightened & Adopted

> John 1:12-13, "But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."

- it's not from ourselves and our efforts, but from delving into God's Word that saves us
- child of God is being a Christian. If you are not a Christian, you are not a child of God

Being part of the family of God means we have been saved. Benefits of being part of the family:

1. **Access**: We have access to God the Father. We are walking temples, and have access to God 100% of the time
2. **Identity**: we have identity in God that doesn't change based on our culture, family, or work. We are not defined by past failure but by future purpose

Jesus is proud to call us part of His family. The good news of God is to forgive all of what you have done to make you a Child.

### Now What? 1

- biggest lifechanges come out of a crisis. As well, most people come to faith or lose their faith out of a crisis. We need to make sure that coming from the COVID-19 crisis, we have life-change in a positive way
  - as Christ followers, we need to pay close attention to emotions. When Lazarus died, Jesus wept. He felt emotions

Our identify is found in the beginning, where the job given to people was to care for the earth and subdue it

- how we respond to emotions has the power to change lives.
