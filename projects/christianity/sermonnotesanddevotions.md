## April 19 2020 - Scandalous 1

Maturity requires proximity

- relational element to model and love essential

> 1 Corinthians 4:18-21, "Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?

- your faith does not rise and fall on your ability to explain, interpret, bring clarity to, or have a perfect understanding of every authors intent or meaning. It is built on Jesus Christ!
- don't just think Bible said it. Engaged, wrestled, juxtaposed, interpreted
