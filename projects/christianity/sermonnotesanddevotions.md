## April 19 2020 - Scandalous 1

Maturity requires proximity

- relational element to model and love essential

> 1 Corinthians 4:18-21, "Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power. What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?

- your faith does not rise and fall on your ability to explain, interpret, bring clarity to, or have a perfect understanding of every authors intent or meaning. It is built on Jesus Christ!
- don't just think Bible said it. Engaged, wrestled, juxtaposed, interpreted

## April 26 2020 - Scandalous 2

> 1 Corinthians 5:5, "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles—that a man has his father’s wife! And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you. For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."

- The Jesus COmmunity is an Imperfect Community
- Tolerance inside the church is empty faith
  - Sometimes, "get out" is the right response
  - Transformation requires crucial conversation
    - Opinions are varied, stakes are high, emotions are running strong

What does *hand this man over to Satan* mean?

- Bring person out of church so they can be brought back to their senses and be restored to community
- Reclamation and Restoration, not Obliteration and Damnation
  - Scandalous message of grace
