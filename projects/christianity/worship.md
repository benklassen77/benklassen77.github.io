# Worship

## August 29 2023

Conversational notes:

- Worship is unceasing (Harold Best)
- "Worship is the continuous outpouring of all that I am, all that I do, and all that I can ever become, in light of a chosen God"
	- Worship never stops. It does change direction
- It is not thinking less of yourself. It is thinking of yourself less

What are the types of biblical worship? Some are seen here: [https://godsbreath.net/2015/03/05/greek-words-for-worship-in-the-bible/](https://godsbreath.net/2015/03/05/greek-words-for-worship-in-the-bible/). This are summarized below:

- Proskuneo (Προσκυνέω): worship, or to prostrate (lying stretched out on the ground with one's face downward). This is what corporate Sunday worship should look like
- Latreuo (λατρεύω): worship through service. It is the consistent, self-giving worship that makes up life.
