## Romans

### Romans 1

9-10 *God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you in my prayers at all times - and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you*

- Paul constantly prayed, and asked for God's answer according to His will

16 *For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed - a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith."*

- Paul was not ashamed of the gospel

19-20 *Since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the wolrd God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse*

- Nobody is without excuse when it comes to salvation

21 *For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened*

- When we don't glorify God or praise Him, our path becomes dark

24-27 *Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshoped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error*

- Homosexuality is a sin, caused by being distanced from the Lord

28 *Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done*

- Not pursuing God leads to pursuing one's own desires

32 *Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them*

- It is sinful to approve of sinful acts

### Romans 2

3-4 *So when you, a mere human being, pass judgement on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgement? Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?*

- Our convictions must lead to repentance
- There shouldn't be judgement for one another

7-11 *To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. For God does not show favouritism.

- One needs to persistently do good, seek glory, honour, and immorality
- It is evil to be self-seeking and reject the Lord's truth
- God doesn't show favouritism

13-14 *For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them

- The Holy Spirit defends and convicts
- The righteous must obey the law placed on their hearts

23-24 *You who boast in the law, do you dishonour God by breaking the law? As it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you*

- It isn't my place to rely on the law for salvation

28-29 *A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God.

- The written law doesn't circumcise, but rather the transformation of the heart by the Spirit is circumcision.
- The Spirit needs to lead our life
- A person's praise is from God!
