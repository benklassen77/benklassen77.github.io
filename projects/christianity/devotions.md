## Romans

### Romans 1

9-10 *God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you in my prayers at all times - and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you*

- Paul constantly prayed, and asked for God's answer according to His will

16 *For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed - a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith."*

- Paul was not ashamed of the gospel

19-20 *Since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the wolrd God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse*

- Nobody is without excuse when it comes to salvation

21 *For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened*

- When we don't glorify God or praise Him, our path becomes dark

24-27 *Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshoped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error*

- Homosexuality is a sin, caused by being distanced from the Lord

28 *Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done*

- Not pursuing God leads to pursuing one's own desires

32 *Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them*

- It is sinful to approve of sinful acts
