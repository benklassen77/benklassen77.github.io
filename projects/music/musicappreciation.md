## Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror

- We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.

4 Assumptions of music as a mirror

1. For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change
2. Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music
3. As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes
4. As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music

- disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy
- Classical = 1750 - 1827.

## Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church

**Ancient World** = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]

- Only 40ish pieces survived
- Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes
- Greece music was humanistic
  - Contained the doctrine of ethos
  - Based on pythagorus's theorum on music

- Music is not like math

600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.

**Principles of Music in Early Church** = 3 things

1. Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\
2. Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.
3. Large choruses, "bright" melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.

- Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).
- Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music

## Lecture 3: Middle Ages

Middle Ages: 600 AD - 1400 AD

- Dark Ages: 600-1000
- High Middle Ages: 1000-1400

### Dark Ages

Music in Early Medieval Church

1. Created mood conducive to long hours of prayerful contemplation
2. Embellished formal services

- Viewed music as a tool of ceremony and ritual
- Dance music with beat was frowned upon because reminded us of our sexuality

**Plainchant** = unadorned and unaccompanied, single unaccompanied melody line called a monophony (one sound)

- commonly refered to as gregorian chant due to Pope Gregory's time
- plainchant hymn = straightforward, memorable, compact melody, melody repeated with each new text stanza
  - sung during the hours, but never at church
    - **Matins**: held before dawn
    - **Lauds**: held at daybreak
    - **Vespers**: held at sunset
- monotone plainchant = sung on a single pitch

**Monophonic texture** = single, unaccompanied melody line

### High Middle Ages

- technologies like farming came back to Europe
- Christianity brought back civility and culture
- Universities founded
- Specialties occured with cities
- Architecture improved
  - Canterbury Cathedral (1070)
  - Notre Dame (1163)
  - Chartres Cathedral (1223)
  - Cologne (12478)
- Dante etc.
- Crusades occurred

**Polyphony** = musical texture in which there are 2 or more musical melodies heard simultaneously

- composer and notation started. This lead to music with ego, and named works
  - lead to modern view of music as self-expressive / egocentric

**Organum** = 2-part polyphonic composition, with plainchant and Word of God, is present in one voice and the hand of man (decorative voice) celebrates and elaborateas the word of God.

- Tenore = lower sustained voice
- Duplum = decorative voice

**Florid organum** = flowery organum from 1150-1300. Much was composed in Notre Dame

- group of composers in florid called ars antiqua
  - 2 composers leonin and perotin

**Melisma** = single syllable is sung over multiple changing pitches

1. Between 1305-1378, Babylonian Captivity took place. Pope took over land. After this, Great Schism occurred with doubts of faith.
2. Black Death 1347-1350
3. Hundred Years War 1338-1453

- Created swing towards secular art and liturature.
  - Divine Comedy (Dants), Canterbury Tales (Chaucer), Decameron (Boccaccio)

Ars nova: the new art. This is 14th century music

- secular
- extraordinary, polyphonic complexity. **Isorhythm** = 2 basic aspects of music melody and rhythm could be isolated
  - One isorhythmic composer Guillaume de Machaut. Eg. Quant en moy (1350)
- art became more humanistic again

## Lecture 4 - Intro to the Renaissance

2 rules of thought that explain shift from God-serving to egocentric society

1. MEDIEVAL THOUGHT: credo ut intelligam: understanding can only come through belief
2. 15th CENTURY THOUGHT: intelligo ut credam: belief can only come through understanding

Reneissance Events

- classicism: language, literature, philosophy, art, architecture etc.

> "At the core of ancient greek and roman writings {rhetoric, education, poetry, morals philosophy}, the central figure was not Christ; not the transient, 'worthless' figure of humankind as described by mediaval theologians, but man - independent, intelligent, adventurous, and capable" - Burke

- lead to humanism movement, with emphasis on human accomplishments
- 95 thesis - Martin Luther
- Education: secular education. Highered scholars instead of church
- Printing press (1450)
- Art (botticelli, da vince, rafael)

Renaissance Music

- Clear articulation of the words
  - Music cannot be overly mellismatic (eg. Leonin). This was obsolete by 15th century
- Concept that music should reflect and intensify the meaning of the words (word-painting)

**Consonant**: blend well

**Dissonant**: do not blend well

- The more complex the ratios are, the more dissonant

**Homophonic Texture**: Foreground (melody), middle ground (baseline) and background (inner voices)

- Josquin des Prez is a very highly respected musician of the Renaissance
  - **High Renaissance Style**: Fluid, lacking sharp rhythmic edge generally, smooth, conjunct, controlled polyphony, occasional homophony
  - Petite Camusette is an example of **imitative polyphony**: parts imitate each other here and there (1500)

- Giovanni del Palestrina was other great

|Quant en moy|Petite Camusette|
|----|----|
|Foreign, spiky, isorhythmic|Clear, conjunct, clear, homogenous|
|French love song| French love song|

**A capella** = as in chapel

Because of the printing press, Josquin's followers could learn his music faster, as well as ensure further change in musical styles.

Great Renaissance Polyphonists Shortlist

- Johannes Ockeghem
- Guillaume dufay
- Jacob Obrecht
- Heinrich Isaac
- Jean Mouton
- Jacob Arcadelt
- Orlando Lassus

## Lecture 5 - Renaissance Mass

Mass as religious ceremony

Ite missa est: congregation is dismissed

- Mass derived from missa
- In the day, mass was daily
- reenactment of last supper

**High Mass** = Missa solemnis, or full mass

PARTS OF THE MASS

The High Mass

1. Introductory Liturgy of the Word
2. Liturgy of the Eucharist (giving of thanks)

Smaller sections (category of activity)

1. Proper: sections that change from day to day
   - 11 of 17 sections of high mass: Introit, Collects, Epistle, Gradual, Alleluia, Sequence, Gospel, Offertory, Preface, Communion, and Post-Communion respectively
   - texts change on regular basic
2. Ordinary: sections do not change ever
   - 6 of 17 sections: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Its missa est.

**Kyrie** = "Lord have mercy upon us; Christ have mercy upon us."

**Gloria** = "Glory be to God"

**The Credo** = google

**The Sanctus** = "holy, holy, holy"; introduces eucharistic prayer

**Agnus Dei** = Lamb of God

**Ite missa est** = Let us bless the Lord and be dismissed

- since ordinary is repeated, it was chosen to be accompanied by music
- Guillaume de Machaut wrote "The Mass of Notre Dame". This set the ordinary to music
  - First 5 parts of ordinary were set to music
  - Used a plainchant to link all parts. Plainchant was historically the Word of God.

3 species of mass commonalities

1. Constitute settings of ordinary of mass
2. Soprano, alto, tenor, bass (4 parts)
3. Employ triadic harmonic constructs

3 species

1. Cantus firmus mass (fixed melody)
   - used plainchants, which are modal and tenor
   - least complex
2. Paraphrase mass
   - Josphin des Prez wrote these. Eg. Ave maris stella. Agnus Dei No 3 beautiful especially :)
   - turns plainchant from modal into tonal, and becomes subliminal
3. Imitation mass
   - Based on preexisting melody; not plainchant but any melody
   - Protestent Reformation ended this

Protestent Reformation

- Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to church

Impact on mass = **Counter Reformation**

- Council of Trent (1545-1563)
  - Think tank that came together to problem solve what went wrong
  - Ended imitation mass, complex polyphony (need to understand words), instruments in church, and attitude of singers

> The "Canon on music to be used in the mass" - council of trent, illustrated many problems in church music

- **Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina** (1525-1594) = "saviour of Catholic church music"
  - Composed 6 part polyphonic mass, which was accepted by the council of trent
    - Each syllable is heard by itself, such that while there are several voices, each word is heard in a single voice
  - Wrote 104 masses. Eg. Pope Marcellus Mass

## Lecture 6 - The Madrigal

**Madrigal** = a secular, unaccompanied vocal work for four to six individual voices

- Not choral compositions
- Madrigal was most important genre of Italian secular music in 16th century
- Because of Madrigal, Italy became center of European music
- Contained poetry
- Free mix of polyphonic and monophonic parts
- Became increasingly bound up with finding a way to express the literary meaning of a poem
- Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374) was great Italian poet of 13th century
- Pietro Bembo (1470-1547) was poet, statesman, and a cardinal. He was a Petrarch fanatic, and popularized Petrarch's poetry.
- Cipriano de Rore (1516-1565), from Flanders, wrote "Datemi pace o duri miei pensieri", is based on a sonnet by Francesco Petrarch, who's heart betrayed him.
  - Projects mood of sonnet
  - Repeats literal words of sonnet
  - Last line of magrigal treated epigrammatically

> Example of word painting as jarring line suggests jarred heart

- Modern artists must balance modernality and coherence
- Carlo Gesualdo was a wealthy amateur who was talented, and didn't have to work for a patron. This gave him more creative freedom. Eg. "Io parto"
- The Triumph of Oriana, by Thomas Morley, contains many English Madrigals. Eg. "As Vesta Was from Latmos Hill Descending" by Thomas Wilkes

## Lecture 7 - Introduction to the Baroque Era (1600-1750)

**Opera** = stage drama set to music

**Johann Sebastian Bach** (1685-1750)

**Baroque** (barocca): pearl of irregular shape or colour

- Derogatory term for art that was considered overly extravagant (18th century definition)
- By the 1920s, this definition remained in similar meaning but instead with a positive tonality. It shifted to flamboyant, extravagant, and highly detailwd art/music between 1600-1750

**Baroque Era** = time of increasing secularism and scientific discovery

- Galileio's era
- John Kepler discovered formulas on orbit of planets
- Microorganisms
- Blood circulatoin
- Isaac Newton's time
  - Newton believed God is a watchmaker, and the cosmos were God's watch. Believed in God and Science
- The Baroque belief that logical systems (invisible hand of God) rationally controlled the complexity of the World manifested itself in art that celebrated detail controlled by symmetry
- Baroque design about ornament and embellishment. However, it is never chaotic or confused. The era was defined by symmetry, rationality, order and logic controlling detail.
- It was so orderly that they would have hated Swiss Alps or Niagara Falls, since they were not so controlled or orderly.

**Baroque Music** = expressive exuberance and surface extravagance, carefully tempered and controlled by rhythm, a systemic approach to harmony, and symmetrical (cyclical) music forms

|**Religious Topic**|Renaissance (Agnus Dei)|Baroque (Hosanna)|
|----|----|----|
|**Nature of religiousity**|Sober prayer|Extravagant celebration|

|**Secular Topic**|Renaissance (As Vesta Was from Latmos)|Baroque (Dido's Lament)|
|----|----|----|
|**What exactly is being expressed?**|Word-painting. Madrigal is all about words|Opera all about individual emotions|
|**Emotional Impact**|Generic|Individual emotions|

Madrigal vs. Opera

- Not just about __Word Painting__ and __Emotional Expression__; more profoundly, it is also about difference between group expression and individual expression
- Opera development lead to rise of individual in Western culture. Thus, it has had the most important ramifications in the last 400 years

Magnificence and Absoluteism in Baroque Music

- Extraordinary architecture commissioned by kings to rival that made for God
- Louis 14 is greatest example of this

### The French Overture

**Overture** = instrumental word that precedes a stage work

- French Overture is royal version, very magnificent that could welcome a king
- Louis commissioned Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687)
  - Based on Lully's famous style, George Frederick Handel (1685-1759) started his Messiah as a French Overture. Eg. Water Music

French Overture Components

Part 1. Characterized by sweeping scales; a slow, plodding tempo; and dotted (long/short) rhythms
Part 2. Characterized by imitative polyphony and fast tempo

## Lecture 8 - Style Features of Baroque-era Music

Big, Bold Statements

1. Baroque Era fascinated with substance and power of individual human emotions
   - infatuation with theater and invention of opera. Shakespeare from this timeperiod
2. Emotional and expressive exuberance in Baroque-era music that sets it apart from the more restrained and sober music of the Renaissance
3. Era of great scientific investigation and codification
   - Emphasis on logic and control
   - Epressive exuberance tempered by intellectual control
4. Decreasing political power of church of the Church gave rise to the absolute monarch, who claimed to govern through divine right
5. Rise of genuine instrumental musical tradition during the Baroque illustrates that the syntactical elements of Baroque-era music had became substantial enough that they could, by themselves, create viable musical statement without the need of voices

Instrumental Music = most abstract art yet to humankind

- in drawing or painting, physical object exists in at least 2 dimensions
- sculpture exists in 3 dimensions
- poetry, drama, and literature written in language that we can know and recognize
- Instrumental music is great because it has no words, no literary information beyond its title to explain why it exists and why it sounds the way it does

Basics

**Music** = sound in time, or time defined by sound

- Time: some aspect of rhythm
- Sound: pitches -> motives -> melodies -> texture

**Pitch** = discrete sound, a sound we can sing. It has 2 properties: a single fundamental frequency (what makes an A an A) and timbre, or tone color or overtone (what makes an A on a piano differ from that on a saxophone)

- Note = pitch with duration

**Motive** = a brief succession of notes from which melody grows, through the processes of repetition, sequence, and transformation

- Problem = early composers of instrumental music needed a way to create melodic coherence and logic, a way to create melodies that made abstract sense, unto themselves, in absence of words.
- Baroque great age of sequence

**Melody** = any succession of notes

- Tune: special sort of melody, with a clear beginning, middle and end, and with a property called lyricism
- Lyricism: being songlike for a voice
- Lyric melody: conceived vocally
- Theme: principal musical idea in a given section of music
- Conjunct: pitches are relatively close together
- Disjunct: pitches are scattered apart

**Texture** = refers to the number of melodies and the relationship between those melodies in a given segment of music

- Monophony, monophonic texture: single unnaccompanied melody line
- Polyphony (synonymous to counterpoint and contrapuntal): two or more principal melodic parts, each of equal importance
  - Contrapuntal: against point; or note against note.
  - Imitivate Polyphopnic texture: constituent melodic parts sing/play more-or-less the same melody, but staggered at various time intervals, so that the melody overlaps with itself
    - Strict: each constituent part imitates the other parts exactly. Eg. row row row your boat. Canon or Round
    - Non-strict: voices imitate each other, but not exactly. Therefore, no cyclical groove. Eg. Agnus Dei No. 3, josquin dez pres
  - Non-imitative polyphony: 2 or more simultaneous melodies and different melodies; neither are more important than the other
- Homophony, homophonic texture: one in which one melody is predominant and all other melodic or harmonic material is perceived as being accompanimental

> In the Renaissance, instrumental music was also created as suites: collection of dances

- Instrument design exploded in the Baroque
- Piano invented.. harpsicord mastered
- Flute, oboe, trombone, and violin family came into existence
- Tuning systems (well-tempered) came into existance
- meter (grouping of notes) standardized, as well as bar lines
- Functional harmony came into existence

## Lecture 9 - National Styles Italy and Germany

**Cavatina**: type of aria

- Gioacchino Rossini: THe Barber of Seville (1816)
  - Purpose of this cavatina is to identify Rossina as a saucy, smart and determined young lady and to entertain the audience
- Beethoven: Symphony No. 5 in C-, Movement 1 (1808)
  - Meaning is to be expressed and understood by individual experiences

Italian Quote

> *Music for the Italians is a sensual pleasure and nothing more. Fore this noble expression of the mind, they have hardly more respect than for cooking! They want a score that, like a plate of macaroni, can be assimilated immediately without their having to think about it or even pay attention to it* - Hector Berlioz

German Quote

> *What instrumental work of Beethoven testifies to his art and genius to a higher degree than the immeasurably noble and profound Symphony in C Minor? How this marvelous composition carries the hearer irresistibly with it in its ever-mounting climax into the spirit kingdom of the infinite! What could be simpler than the main motive of the first movement composed of a mere rhythmic figure which, beginning in unison, does not even indicate the key to the listener. The character of anxious, restless longing this passage carries with it only brings out more clearly the melodiousness of the second theme. It appears as if the breast, burned and oppressed by the premonition of tragedy, of threatening annihilation, in gasping tones was struggling with all its strength for air* - E.T.A. Hoffmann

As discovered by these quotes,

- Rossini's cavatina personified the 19th-centure Italian view that 'music = opera' and that opera is a form of entertainment
- Beethoven's symphonic music personifies the German/Austrian view of music as something profound and capable of the deepest metaphorical expression
- Italians great for melody, germans great for harmony

**Nationalism**: the use of folk or ethnic music in concert compositions

- While Beethoven appreciated Rossini's music, he didn't compose the like because it wasn't culturally appropriate
- National styles have to do with language and culture in which composer grew up. This changes how composers perceive their music

Vocal music originated as latin music in Church

> The nature of the language set to music will determine the nature of the melody that results

Vocal music persisted from this and was most developed in Italy for 2 reasons

1. Nature of Italian language (closest to latin)
2. Christian church based in Rome

### Italian Baroque Style

Due to the Madrigal, Italian language replaced Latin as dominant language in vocal music

The style was characterised by:

1. It was an outgrowth of Latin vocalism and the equally vocal character of the Italian language
2. It was essentially a homophonic tradition: melody and accompaniment, the perfect example of which is opera, the dominant art form of the era
3. Exhibited a preference for melodic directness, as opposed to the ornamental complexity of the French style and the polyphonic and harmonic complexity of the Baroque German Style
4. Italian Baroque Opera gave birth to the 2 most important orchestral genres of the next 400 years = symphony and concerto

Italian and Latin are considered **melismatic languages** that, by nature, beg for long, soaring [melismas](#high-middle-ages) when set to music. In contrast, English and German are syllabic languages that prefer one pitch per syllable when being set to music; languages that allow for only occasional melisma.

### Affect of Protestantism on German Style

In 1517, Martin Luther posted 95 Theses

- This lead to counterroman revolution and wars between 1548-1648, including the Thirty Years War (1615-1648)
- This was ended by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648

**Protestantism** stayed after the battle

**Lutheranism** profoundly affected music. It included:

- Papacy rejected, as was supernatural character of priesthood
- Called clergy ministers, not priests and allowed them to marry
- Rejected confessional and priestly absolution
- Abandoned saying of masses and prayers for the dead
- Gave up cults of saints and Virgin Mary
- Declared that the one true source ofChristian belief was the Bible
- Vernacular language replaced Latin in the Church

This change in language lead to the adoption of German-language songs (hymns) to replace Latin plainchant

- hymns (or chorales) became backbones of music across Lutheran communities across Europe

> *After theology, I give music the greatest educational importance and highest honour* - Martin Luther

- this vision of music as close to theology was instrumental in development of Bach and others. Since Luther thought music was a gift of God, music was considered a godly act
- Contrastingly to Catholics who emphasised vocal music, Lutheran communities thought instrumental music could also be used to equally worship God

When enjoying music, if we feel a rush of connection to it, it can be seen in 2 different lights

1. Personification of hedonism. We are self-indulging
2. We leave our egos behind and are susceptible to divine influence

Luther thought that music that made us more susceptible to God was beautiful and promoted it such that it grew far more than in Italian, Catholic communities

### German Baroque Style

Syllabic music demonstrated by "Awake! Now Strikes the Hour" - Bach Cantata no. 140

- setting is one pitch per syllable
- sharp articulations reflectin in sharp, articulated rhythms of the melody
- sharply articulated, compact language creates a sharply articulated, compact tune

Lutheran Church Hymn: staple across Germany

Bach created all his music for God as a Lutheran. He not only dedicated his spiritual works, but also his secular works to God. He inscribed them as INJ (in the name of Jesus). Bach made his compositional technique and spirituality intertwined. His native German language and Lutheran faith that were the cornerstone of his worldview AND the sound of his music.

## Lecture 10 - Fugue

The **Fugue** represents the Baroque era well because it epotomizes the Baroque melodic extravagence and structural control and organization. It is a systematic exploitation of non-strict and strict imitative polyphony. This illustrates perfectly the Baroque predilection for codification and systematic examination

Eg. Bach's Fugue in C Minor from Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1 (1722)

Harpsicord plays at uniform loudness and restricts smearing of notes. This ensures the voices are polyphonically represented. Since the fugue is about non-strict polyphony, the harpsicord represented it well.

**Texture**: how many melodies are simultaneously present in a given section of music and how those melodies are related to one another

- **Monophonic**: texture that consists of a single, unaccompanied melody; one sound, one melody at a time
- **Polyphonic**: texture that has 2 or more simultaneous melodies of equal importance
  - **Imitative**: the constituent voices imitate each other at some distance of time, such that the parts overlap with each other
    - **Strict Imitative**: each voice imitates the others strictly. Creates cyclic effect (eg. row, row, row your boat) that is characteristic of a **canon**
    - **Non-strict Imitative**: voices imitate each other such that they are not in a cyclic feedback loop
- **Homophonic**: texture with one principal melody and everything else is seen as accompanimental

### Tuning

Tuning and Temperment

- In our culture, we divide octate into 12 pitches called chromatic
- Other cultures divide octave into 5 pitches called pentatonic

**Pythagorean Scale**: six successive perfect 5ths. When playing 13 5ths, the last one is 1/8 of an octave short of completing the circle of 5ths, known as the pythagorean comma.

**Mean-tone tuning**: an early Renaissance attempt to shrink some of the fifths but not all of them

**Equal-tempered tuning**: all of the 5ths are equally shrunk. This was discovered in 1500s and wasn't fully used until 1800s. In the time in between, well-tempered tuning was used (12-note system). Each book of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier contained enough preludes and fugues that it would allow for a harpsicord to be tuned in a way that any key would sound in tune. Bach's books were seen as a bible by Mozart and others

### How a Fugue Works

Unless it is a double fugue, fugues are monothematic (built around a single theme)

- A fugue theme is called a subject
  - Subject is a melody designed to do all sorts of things. It is called a subject for the same reason a cadaver is called that rather than a person. It needs to be broken apart, dissected, and then sewn back together

There are 3 structural elements of a fugue:

1. Exposition
2. Episodes
3. Subject restatements

Exposition

- over the exposition, the subject is stated successively in each individual part until all the parts have entered
- in contrast to modern music, where the top layer is most important, fugue music has each layer of equal important. It is thus important to listen to the voices
- once a voice has entered and 'sung' its version of the fugue subject, it will continue with a complementary melody called the counter-subject, a melody generated from the fugue subject itself
- successive entries that characterize a fugal exposition sound a lot like the beginning of a round, a piece of music written in strict imitative polyphony. However, an exposition is not an example of strict-imitative polyphony or a round. It is not imitated strictly, but is an example of non-strict imitative polyphony
- order in which the voices enter must assure that each newly entered voice is, at the moment it enters, either the highest or lowest voice
  - 4 possibilities: soprano-alto-bass, bass-alto-soprano, alto-soprano-bass, alto-bass-soprano

Episodes and Subject Restatements

- following exposition, a fugue will consist of eposides that transit to various restatements of the fugue subject. Most commonly episodes and restatements alternate until one final statement closes
- episodes seen as transitional because they contain motives obtained from the theme's subject and its counter-subject. Episodes are also seen as such because they **modulate**, or effect a change of key
- subject restatements will consist of some with different keys and some of the same key

Subject: composite melody. Motive repeated several times, but lowest note descends over course of subject.

## Lecture 11-12 - Opera

Opera is the finest art form

Eg. Guiseppe Verdi's piece Aida (1871)

- Egyptian warrior, Ethiopian slave girl/Princess Aidi, Jealous Egyptian Princess

**Opera**: a stage play set to music, a spectacle that combines scenery, action, literary drama, and continuous or almost continuous music into a whole greater than its parts

- music intensifies meaning of words

Ancient Greek drama is thought to be a forerunner to opera

### Italian Linguistics

- noun that ends with an 'o' is masculine; a noun that ends with an 'a' is feminine
  - spaghetti singular is spaghetto
- plural ending for masculine or gender-neutral nouns is an 'i'; for feminine nouns an 'e'
- if ends in ino, is diminutive. Means little

### Renaissance and Rebirth of Greek Ideal

- renaissance wanted to recreate musical qualities attributed to Ancient Greeks

The late renaissance/early baroque saw increasing rise of secular drama. Such late 16th century Italian drama was punctuated with musical interludes betwen the acts of the plays, called an **Intermezzo**

**Intermezzo**: meaning in-the-middle (pl. intermezzi). The intermezzo was a sung commentary spoken between acts what commented on the action of the play to that point, and were inspired by the choruses of Greek drama

- by 1580s, intermezzi were so substantial that they had become virtual plays within the play
- increasingly spectacular, they became popular in their own right
  - half-time show becoming more popular than the football game

Eg. Dalle piu alte sfere by Emilio de Cavalieri. Intermedio/Madrigal written for wedding of Grand Duke Ferdinand of Italy in 1589

- frottola: homophonic, accompanied song
- Self-declared Madrigal because of word-painting. Used word high repeatedly with high soprano voice. However, solo-singer makes this intimacy and emotional-directness beyond that of any madrigal
  - in a chorus, each singer can not accentuate his/her part, yet a solo-singer can do whatever she wants. Solo-singer has infinitely more flexibility than individuals in ensemble. It is also far more personal, and that brought about the beginning of opera

Florentine Camerata: an intellectual club of the Italian Renaissance

- people interested in Ancient Greek and contemporary drama/music
- concluded Ancient Greek tragedy must have been sung in an individual voice

> Greeks were able to obtain powerful effects with their music because it consisted of a single melody. This melody could affect the listener's feelings, since it exploited the natural expressiveness of the rises and falls of pitch and the register of the voice and of the changing rhythms and tempos - Girolamo Mei

Galileo's dad also had something to say against polyphony

> The resulting chaos of contradictory impressions serves only to show off the cleverness of the composer and the ability of the performers. Word painting, imitations of sighing, and like should be dismissed as childish. The correct way to set words is to use a solo melody which will enhance the natural speech inflections of a good orator or a good actor - Vincenzo Galilei

Based on the Ancient Greek ideal and the contemporary desired portrayel, the camerata created the "3 Corollaries of Modern Music"

1. Text must be clearly understood. Homophonic texture by solo-singer
2. Words must be sung with correct and natural declamation, as they would be spoken; textual repetitions should be avoided, except for rhetorical reinforcement
3. Melody must not depict mere graphic details like word painting, but rather interpret feelings and emotions of the character singing them. In other words, emotional, not literary, meaning

The camerata had 3 notable composer members:

- Emilio de Cavalieri
- Giulio Caccini
- Jacopo Peri

**Librettist**: poet who wrote an opera's lyrics

### Recitative and Aria

First ever-opera, Euridice (Peri) premiered Oct. 6, 1600 at the Pitti Palace in Florence. It featured the below old and new elements:

- (Old) smallish chorus which sings madrigal-like commentaries in the style of a Greek chorus
- (Old) simply, rhymed songs as lyric interludes to the action, to end scenes, and for transitions between scenes
- (New) representative style, now called **recitative** (a recitation), which became heart and soul of florentine style. Half-spoken, half-sung recitation to carry essential substance of the opera. Used it for narration, dialogue, and action. This allowed large amount of text to be articulated quickly, clearly, and still be sung
- Based on the Orpheus Story, which has other works like Orpheus (Monteverdi 1607), Orpheus (Gluck 1762), Orpheus in the Underworld (Offenbach 1858), and Orpheus (Stravinsky 1947)
  - Orpheus is demigod of Apollo, and personification of what early opera sought to be. Orpheus can win over anyone with his lyre, except Euridice, whom he is in love with. Eventually, she consents to be his wife. Euridice and her friends go to pick flowers for the wedding when she is bitten by a snake, and dies.. it is up to one of her fellow nymphs to tell Orpheus the news. Orpheus reacts with a plan to go down to Hades, cross the River Stix and convince Pluto to release her. He agrees, as long as Orpheus doesn't look back to check if she's there. Orpheus does look back, and Euridice is taken forever. Orpheus is attacked by mynads afterwards
- based on present/future tense without reflection (real-time), as is typical of early opera

Monteverdi was born in Cremona, were Antonio Stadiveri was from. It is a town famous for violins.

- trained by head of music at the cathedral in Cremona
- at 23, he entered the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. In 1602, Monteverdi was made the master of the Dukal chapel in Mantua, and he composed his first opera Orfeo there in 1607.
- between 1613-1643, he was the choir master at St. Marks Cathedral in Venice
- wrote prima practica (1st practise or madrigals) and seconda practica (works for the stage). Most of his seconda practice has been lost.. only 6 have survived
  - Orfeo (1607) combined madrigal style, orchestral and scenic apparatus of intermezzi, and solo singing. Messenger Song very famous. It was the first operatic masterwork and it revolutionized opera
  - The Coronation of Poppea (1642)

**Aria**: by 1660, the aria joined recitative as an opera delivery mechanism. It literally means 'air'.. an accompanied song or melody dating from Elizabethan England (1560-1625) real-time stops

- **Song**: a short, rhymed poem accompanied by music that is usually as simple and direct as a text. Operatic aria different
- **Operatic Aria**: a lengthy, substantial, and often very complex piece of vocal music in which the essential character and dramatic information is transmitted via the music itself
  - Unlike recitative, in which the words carry the expressive message, the music carries the expressive message
  - Baroque's motivic discoveries leading to instrumental music also lead to the operatic aria
  - Like a tip of the iceberg, the aria's words float on top in plain sight, while most of message is carried out of sight by the abstract elements of the music itself

By 1660, recitatives were used for narration, action, and dialogue in an opera (real-time situations); and arias were used for reflection, character development, and for expression of feeling. It is never real-time since time stops

In later Baroque opera, recitative became the dry part between the great arias. Must of Monteverdi's recitative was lost. Recitative was played **secco**, or dry and accombanied only by the basso continuo, a harpsicord, or a cello. Occasionally, **recitative accompanato** is used, which means accompanied by the orchestra

Eg. Dido and Aeneas (Henry Purcell 1659-1695)

> Dido has little to say but much to feel, and the music needs time to convey the emotional message - Joseph Kerman

- repitition of words typical in arias to convey message

Before - rich only could see

1637 - first operahouse opened

1650 - 7 full time operahouse

- unfortunately, as opera was profitable, it was made cheaper with less care, and became less than it was

## Lecture 13 - Oratorio

**Handel's Messiah (1742)**: only Baroque composition performed continuously since its premiere. It is an example of an oratorio

### Overview

Catholic Baroque Sacred Music

- mix of old style and new style
- masses were composed during Baroque. While many were older, many also followed Baroque style, or opera
  - With basso continuo

Basso continuo went from early Baroque recititive to use in many Baroque songs

Even though it had previously been discussed in the counter-reformation that the use of noisy instruments should be ceased, mixing instruments with voices was common with Italian composers

Lutheran Baroque Sacred Music

30 Years War

1. Part of Germany embracing Lutheranism was part of Holy Roman Empire (Charlemagne's Empire in 814)
   - Holy Roman Empire founded to consolidate religion across civilized Europe and as a defensable work against non-Christians
2. Habsbergs in Austria saw Protestantism as a large threat to its national interests
3. Since France saw Habsberg as a threat, it allied with the Protestants against the Austrians even though it was Catholic so that they could fight them on German soil
4. Protestant England allied with the Protestants even though they didn't like the French because they also feared the Austrians
5. The Spanish allied with the Austrians
6. Dutch and Danish allied with the Protestants
7. Lutheran King of Sweden invaded Germany

Countries switched sides based on where the loot was and on who had the upper hand. Over this time, cantata was developed

Sacred Genres of the Baroque

**Oratorio**: extended work for chorus, vocal soloists, and orchestra based on a dramatic story drawn from scripture, and performed as a concert work without acting

- not part of church service, and for catholics and christians
- opera on a religious subject
  - has recitatives and arias and implied actions with multiple acts
  - difference between Renaissance mass and Baroque Oratorio is difference between ritual and restraint and expressive exuberance
- evolved from sacred dialogues
  - by 1650, these productions were called oratorios because they were performed in small chapels called oratories
- unlike opera, it utilized chorus with a **testo**, or a narrator
- oratorios became popular in Italy in 17th century because of Lent. Theatrical productions were banned during this time, so oratorios were seen

**Cantata**: like an oratorio but shorter

- Lutheran cantatas were part of the church service

**Mass**: 5 part sections of ordinary for Catholics. Lutheran mass only had the Kyrie and Gloria

**Magnificat**: latin-language cantata based on the canticle of the virgin from the Gospel of Luke

**Passion**: an oratorio based on one of the Gospel accounts of the events colminating in the crucifixion of Christ

- Created for Holy Week services for Catholics and Christians

**Motet**: cantata featuring an unaccompanied, a cappella chorus

All of these genres are distinguished from Baroque opera by their use of chorus to emphasize the people or Christianity itself

Why wasn't chorus used in opera?

1. Expensive
2. It could be seen in church anyway

### Oratorio in England

George Frederick Handel (1685-1759) was born in Lutheran Germany. Unlike Bach, Handel trained in Italy and worked in Hanover before going to England.

- composed over 30 Italian operas between 1715-1740 for English audience
- advertised well to upper class
- by 1740, audiences were smaller because of growing middle class that didn't favour aristocrastic music. Hence, Handel started writing oratorios. He wrote 26, including Saul, Solomon, and Messiah

Messiah was composed in 24 days. **PART 1** is almost entirely narrative, discusses the prophecy of the Messiah's coming, Christ's birth, and the announcement of redemption for all people. **PART 2** describes human redemption through Christ's sacrifice, humankind's rejection of that redemption, and humankind's defeat by God by their opposition to His power. **PART 3** represents eternal life through Christ the Redeemer.

Hallelujah Chorus

- the king stood during the Hallelujah chorus. Because of that, it is customary to stand for that chorus to this day
- 3 types of writings: homophony when chorus begins, voices are united in singing word hallelujah; imitative polyphony (and he shall reign forever and ever); and responsorial singing: the soprano sings "King of Kings, Lord of Lords" followed by the the alto, tenor, and basses response "Forever, Hallelujah"

## Lecture 14 - Lutheran Church Cantata

**Lutheran Church Cantata**: a one-act religious opera to be performed as part of the Sunday service

### Lutheran 'Chorale' and Congregational Hymn

Lutheran litergy stressed group participation through congregational singing

**Lutheran Church Chorale**: a direct, songlike setting of a sacred text

Because of the German language, music is a syllabic setting, or punchy tunes with one pitch per syllable. Results in punchy, highly motivic music

Chorales selected based on the contents of the sermon. Cantata performed immediately before the sermon, and was based on the day's chorale. Since the cantata reflected the sermon's message, it was nicknamed the sermon in music.

Lutheran Sunday Service

1. Prescribed Bible reading
2. Primary chorale sung
3. Cantata performed based on the chorale
4. Sermon

- orthodox prefered using all available resources to make songs more interesting
- pietist party distrusted high art and opulence in worship

THe more liberal orthodox was more popular, giving rise to Lutheran cantata.

Erdman Neumeister (1671-1756) was first great cantata librettist

- orthodox
- wrote his cantatas based on Italian opera

Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)

- Bach thought his best position was being the court composer for Prince Leopold of Anhalt (1717-1723)
- After this, Bach was **kapelmeister**, or music director for the churches and municipality of the city
- composed 350 cantatas, but 290 survived
- Bach believed in the orthodox view of making cantatas with the resources of an opera, but his superiors were pietists
- known for astonishing harmony

Eg. Bach's Cantata No. 140

- lyrics written by librettist Christian Friedrich Henrici 'Picander' (1700-1764)
- first movement features first verse of chorale
  - ritornello theme (instrumental). This means a melodic idea that returns periodically
    - consisted of 3 distinct phrases characterized by their own melodic material. A sounds like a french overture, B sees rising and falling of motives, and C sees upwards sweeping scales
  - chorale melody sung by soprano voice
  - alto, tenor, and bass sing commentary on chorale melody
- fourth movement features second verse of chorale
  - ritornello theme, notturno: nocturne
- seventh (final) movement features third verse of chorale
- second and fifth movement are recitatives
- third and sixth movement are duets

**Fugato**: a passage that sounds like exposition of a fugue that's not in a fugue

## Lecture 15 - Passacaglia

### Composers, Inspiration and Craft

Musical form is the most important factor in determining how music is expressed

- how many large sections of music there are within a movement of music, and how those sections are related to one another
- in vocal music, the poetic structure of the words being set almost invariably determines the form of the piece of music that results
- in instrumental music, form is the result of compositional processes: repetition, variation, contrast, and development. Unlike vocal music (bounded by words), instrumental music bounded only by time

Baroque was key to allowing instrumental music to become established in its own right.

**Baroque Variations Procedures**: musical forms or processes that are based on an ongoing process of variation. A movement will state a theme, followed by sections that vary the theme as well

**Passacaglia**: type of baroque variation, along with others such as ground bass, chaconne, and ciacona

- theme is a bass line or a harmonic progression built upon that bass line. Once stated, bass line or harmonic progression is cyclically repeated on the same pitches until the end.
- cyclical repetition of the bass line or the harmonic progression is the **given**, or the formal element shared between the composer and the audience. The upper voices layered on top are **varied**
- each new cycle, or **repetition** of the bass line is considered a variation because of the changing nature of the material above it
- typical of Baruqoe because theme is structural rather than a surface element
  - structural theme controls how song sounds

Eg. Dido's Lament (Purcell)

- typical of passacaglia, the aria begins monophonically with the bass line played by itself
  - fugue also starts monophonically with a subject in a single voice. There are, however, differences
    - in a fugue, second voice to enter etc, will enter w/ the subject. In a passacaglia, we hear the theme repeated verbatim in the bass
- fluid because the melodic line's phrases don't always correspond to the beginnings and ends of the ground bass theme
- theme is structural element. When listening to this song, don't focus on bassline but rather on voice

Eg. Passacaglia in C Minor for Organ (Bach 1715)

- there are 3 clusters of variations:
  - variations 1-10 have steady buildup of polyphonic and rhythmic complexity
  - variations 11-15 has a theme out of the deep bass, up an octave or 2, and has successively more quiet upper voices. This creates the illusion of musical departure
  - variations 16-20 has the ground bass theme back in the deep bass, volume increased, and the earlier heavy mood resumes

## Lecture 16 - Ritornello Form and Baroque Concerto

**Instrumental Genre**: distinctive types or categories of instrumental compositions

- **Chamber work**: a piece of music written for one player per part. Eg. String Quartet (2 violins, viola, and cello)
- **Orchestral work**: a piece of music in which one or more of the parts is doubled
- **Chamber orchestra**: instrumental ensumble that looks like a mini orchestra, in which we have one of each major orchestral instrument, though none of them are doubled
  - one of each of: 1st violin, 2nd violen, viola, cello, bass, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, french horn, piano, conductor

Baroque Opera Orchestra: most important orchestra of late 16th and early 17th century

- served persons and propoganda of Louis IV
- **French Overture** was one of the first orchestral works composed as an orchestral work
- **Italian Overture (Sinfonie)** evolved into the symphony during the Classical Era

**Orchestral Suite**: collections of dances (ballet episodes) that were extracted from French operas, arranged for orchestra, and published as self-standing works

**Baroque Concerto**: consists of one or more instrumental soloists accompanied by, or pitted against the body of the orchestra

- theatrical as it contrasts individual (soloist) and collective (orchestra)
- by High Baroque (1700-1750), concerto was the single most important genre of orchestral music
- composed by Vivaldi, Telemond, Handel and Bach
  - eg. Brandenburg Concerti or Four Seasons

Eg. Brandenburg Concerto no. 5 in D Major (Bach 1721)

- ripieno concerto
- sent to prince of Brandenburg in search of a job
- thematic statements, or ritornello, are played homophonicaly in a concerto grosso. Solo episodes are played polyphonic

Types of Baroque Concerti

- **Orchestral (ripieno) concerto**: scored for strings and basso continuo alone, in which there are no particular soloists and the first violins collectively play principal melodic material. Not a symphony because of its themes and content
- **Concerto grosso**: means the big or grand concerto. Features 2, 3, or 4 soloists
- **Solo concerto**: features a single soloist accompanied by, or pitted against, an orchestra
  - great composers were corelli, vivaldi, and bach

**Tutti**: entire ensemble, orchestra and soloist

**Ripieno**: accompanying ensemble (orchestra but no soloists)

**Concertino**: soloists in a concerto grosso

- ino means little, inferring literally small ensemble

While Fugues and Passacaglias are monothematic, concerti have a contrast between soloist and ensemble, making them special

- Most High Baroque concerti had 3 movements
  - 1st movement structured in ritornello form; the opening musical idea returns periodically
  - 2nd movement will be a slow movement (adagio) meant to provide a lyric respite from the rigors of the 1st movement
  - 3rd movement will by fast and fugue-like

Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) was from Venice

- taught Bach how to teach concerti

## Lecture 17 - The Enlightenment

Comparison of instrumentation, texture, nature, and expressive content between Baroque and Classical

|Bach's Fugue in C-|Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C- op. 13 2nd Movement|
|----|----|
|Harpsicord|Piano|
|Polyphonic|Homophonic|
|Highly motivic|amotivic|
|Exuberance tempered by control|Contrived to sound like a human voice. About subtle, direct and natural feeling|

**Dynamics**: relative loud or soft in a given section of music. If fixed, like harpsichord, it cannot change volume

- Baroque dynamics are called terrace dynamics because they're either loud or soft
- Harpsichord's quick attack and decay, and inability to have dynanics makes it the ideal keyboard instrument for the complex melodies and polyphonic textures found in Baroque-era keyboard music

Bartolomeo Cristofori: piano inventor

- called it **Gravicembalo col piane e forte**, or big harpsichord with soft and loud

Classica Era (1750-1827, or death of Bach to death of Beethoven)

- dates are lousy. Eg. Giovanni Pergolesi's La serva padrona opera in 1733. 1730-1760 contained both Baroque and Classical

**The Enlightenment**: period between 1730-1780

- institutions of Europe slowly lower their focus from the aristocracy and the clergy to the middle class

Before, the aristocracy owned the land, which allowed farming and all sorts of production to occur. By early 18th century, new patterns of trade, manufacturing, population growth, and beginnings of Industrial Revolution shifted some wealth from inherited land to accumulated cash

> In the new, dynamic, entrepreneurial atmosphere, the principal aim in life was to make money, found a dynasty, and buy a landed position. "Without money, there is no respect, honour, or convenience to be acquired in life [Tobias Smollett]" - James Burke

People wanted education, some political power, and more control over their own lives. Universal education first emerged during the enlightenment. People also wanted an end to social and religious injustice. They also wanted comfort, mobility, and a high quality of life. Thus, **enlightenment humanism** suggested that life on earth and the quality of that life was as important as afterlife through religion. In 1760s, 70s, and 80s, powerful people obliged.

**Cosmopolitanism** saw nationalism downplayed in favor of the common humanity of all people. While ideals existed, the following still existed:

- slavery
- imperialism
- parochialism

Cosmopolitanism influenced classical music. Common international musical style would eventually be known as the classical style

- combined melodic fluency of Italians; rigor and spirituality of the Germans; and instrumental techniques and technology of the French
- music obscured nationalities of composers

With enlightenment, middle class wanted free time, and spent it on music. Bach's music was seen as for the royal or very wealthy, while classical appealed to the people. Classical was considered natural (good), while Baroque music was considered unnatural.

Eg. Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik Mov. 2

- homophonic
- sounds like the human voice
- principal theme is a tune, the point of the piece
- lyric melody (tunes) are characteristic of classical era

**Amateurism**: rise of people who aren't professionals but play at home

- play pieces that they are both able to play and want to play
- fugue's sound easy, but they're hard to play. Amateurs like songs that are easy but sound difficult.

Eg. Piano Sonata in C+ (Mozart) Movement 1

- seems easy, but is harder than you think
- been designed intentionally to seem simple
- mozarts complexities lie below the surface of the music. Phrase structure, accompanimental texture, harmonic motion, thematic contrast, motivic development, and differentiating thematic music from transitional music. Bach carries complexities on the surface

Like an adolescent rejects his parents to define himself, Classical Era rejected Baroque music as unnatural, overcomplicated, and elitist. Enlightenment viewed music as decorative art rather than spiritual.

> Music is an innocent luxury, unnecessary to our existence but a great improvement and gratification of the sense of hearing - Charles Burney

- Bach would've punched Burney and said, "Music is a gift from God to be used only in His Honour dimwit"

## Lecture 18 - Viennese Classical Style: Homophony and Cadence

Classical style celebrated melodic beauty and clarity above all else. It contained:

1. Clarity and beauty of line (melody)
2. Balance and purity of form (clear structures)
3. Expressive restraint and good taste

- Pachelbel's Canon (1700)
  - Not a canon at all, but a passacaglia
  - monothematic, rhythmically continuous, and cyclically organized
  - once theme stated, repetitions are cycled and slightly different or almost interchangeable.

**Cadence**: harmonic or melodic formula that occurs at the end of a phrase, section, or movement that conveys a momentary or permanent sense of conclusion. A musical punctuation mark

- Classical put emphasis on this, while Baroque downplayed
- There are 4 types of cadences

1. **Open or Half Cadence**: in any key, there is a chord that creates tremendous dissonance, tension, and need to resolve. That chord is the one built on the pitch of a perfect fifth above the tonic of any key
2. **Closed Cadence**: resolves from the dominant chord to the tonic chord. Equivalent of a period
3. **Deceptive Cadence**: dominant chord resolves, but not to the tonic. After this, one has to search for the tonic to close at the end
4. **Plagal (Amen) Cadence**: consists of chord progression from subdominant to tonic

Baroque Cyclical Structure vs. Classical Linear Structure

- in Baroque, jazz, or rock, stopping does not occur for cadences. However, they do occur for classical

## Lecture 19 - Theme and Variations

- adapted from Baroque ground bass

Closed cadence seals off section of music from whatever comes next.

Three ways music can relate to each other: repetition, variation, and contrast

**Variation** features the same thematic material but set differently. Eg. passacaglia

- many songs based on an existing theme in order to show the ability of the composer to adapt it
- each variation will have the same basic harmonic and cadence structure as the theme
- each variatin will have the same internal phrase structure as the theme

In Mozart's Theme and Variations

- theme first presented very simply. aababa with easily perceived cadences
- theme is duple, or has notes grouped by 2. Homophonic
- structurally, each variation will mirror the theme
- 2nd variation has aaba
- 8th variation has minor with appearance of imitative polyphony
- 10th variation crosshand

## Lecture 20 - Minuet and Trio

**Menuetto**: minuet and trio form

Stylized Dances

- instrumental works based on rhythms and moods of various dances, but intented for listening rather than dancing
- called partitas, suites, or orchestral suites
- eg. ragtime is a stylized dance
- rock and roll is dance music
- Baroque dance music was homophonic
  - **Gavotte**: 2-step of french origin. Lully and rameau wrote these
