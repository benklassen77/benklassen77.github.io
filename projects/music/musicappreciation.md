## Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror

- We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.

4 Assumptions of music as a mirror

1. For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change
2. Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music
3. As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes
4. As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music

- disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy
- Classical = 1750 - 1827.

## Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church

**Ancient World** = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]

- Only 40ish pieces survived
- Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes
- Greece music was humanistic
  - Contained the doctrine of ethos
  - Based on pythagorus's theorum on music

- Music is not like math

600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.

**Principles of Music in Early Church** = 3 things

1. Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\
2. Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.
3. Large choruses, "bright" melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.

- Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).
- Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music

## Lecture 3: Middle Ages

Middle Ages: 600 AD - 1400 AD

- Dark Ages: 600-1000
- High Middle Ages: 1000-1400

### Dark Ages

Music in Early Medieval Church

1. Created mood conducive to long hours of prayerful contemplation
2. Embellished formal services

- Viewed music as a tool of ceremony and ritual
- Dance music with beat was frowned upon because reminded us of our sexuality

**Plainchant** = unadorned and unaccompanied, single unaccompanied melody line called a monophony (one sound)

- commonly refered to as gregorian chant due to Pope Gregory's time
- plainchant hymn = straightforward, memorable, compact melody, melody repeated with each new text stanza
  - sung during the hours, but never at church
    - **Matins**: held before dawn
    - **Lauds**: held at daybreak
    - **Vespers**: held at sunset
- monotone plainchant = sung on a single pitch

**Monophonic texture** = single, unaccompanied melody line

### High Middle Ages

- technologies like farming came back to Europe
- Christianity brought back civility and culture
- Universities founded
- Specialties occured with cities
- Architecture improved
  - Canterbury Cathedral (1070)
  - Notre Dame (1163)
  - Chartres Cathedral (1223)
  - Cologne (12478)
- Dante etc.
- Crusades occurred

**Polyphony** = musical texture in which there are 2 or more musical melodies heard simultaneously

- composer and notation started. This lead to music with ego, and named works
  - lead to modern view of music as self-expressive / egocentric

**Organum** = 2-part polyphonic composition, with plainchant and Word of God, is present in one voice and the hand of man (decorative voice) celebrates and elaborateas the word of God.

- Tenore = lower sustained voice
- Duplum = decorative voice

**Florid organum** = flowery organum from 1150-1300. Much was composed in Notre Dame

- group of composers in florid called ars antiqua
  - 2 composers leonin and perotin

**Melisma** = single syllable is sung over multiple changing pitches

1. Between 1305-1378, Babylonian Captivity took place. Pope took over land. After this, Great Schism occurred with doubts of faith.
2. Black Death 1347-1350
3. Hundred Years War 1338-1453

- Created swing towards secular art and liturature.
  - Divine Comedy (Dants), Canterbury Tales (Chaucer), Decameron (Boccaccio)

Ars nova: the new art. This is 14th century music

- secular
- extraordinary, polyphonic complexity. **Isorhythm** = 2 basic aspects of music melody and rhythm could be isolated
  - One isorhythmic composer Guillaume de Machaut. Eg. Quant en moy (1350)
- art became more humanistic again

## Lecture 4 - Intro to the Renaissance

2 rules of thought that explain shift from God-serving to egocentric society

1. MEDIEVAL THOUGHT: credo ut intelligam: understanding can only come through belief
2. 15th CENTURY THOUGHT: intelligo ut credam: belief can only come through understanding

Reneissance Events

- classicism: language, literature, philosophy, art, architecture etc.

> "At the core of ancient greek and roman writings {rhetoric, education, poetry, morals philosophy}, the central figure was not Christ; not the transient, 'worthless' figure of humankind as described by mediaval theologians, but man - independent, intelligent, adventurous, and capable" - Burke

- lead to humanism movement, with emphasis on human accomplishments
- 95 thesis - Martin Luther
- Education: secular education. Highered scholars instead of church
- Printing press (1450)
- Art (botticelli, da vince, rafael)

Renaissance Music

- Clear articulation of the words
  - Music cannot be overly mellismatic (eg. Leonin). This was obsolete by 15th century
- Concept that music should reflect and intensify the meaning of the words (word-painting)

**Consonant**: blend well

**Dissonant**: do not blend well

- The more complex the ratios are, the more dissonant

**Homophonic Texture**: Foreground (melody), middle ground (baseline) and background (inner voices)

- Josquin des Prez is a very highly respected musician of the Renaissance
  - **High Renaissance Style**: Fluid, lacking sharp rhythmic edge generally, smooth, conjunct, controlled polyphony, occasional homophony
  - Petite Camusette is an example of **imitative polyphony**: parts imitate each other here and there (1500)

- Giovanni del Palestrina was other great

|Quant en moy|Petite Camusette|
|----|----|
|Foreign, spiky, isorhythmic|Clear, conjunct, clear, homogenous|
|French love song| French love song|

**A capella** = as in chapel

Because of the printing press, Josquin's followers could learn his music faster, as well as ensure further change in musical styles.

Great Renaissance Polyphonists Shortlist

- Johannes Ockeghem
- Guillaume dufay
- Jacob Obrecht
- Heinrich Isaac
- Jean Mouton
- Jacob Arcadelt
- Orlando Lassus

## Lecture 5 - Renaissance Mass

Mass as religious ceremony

Ite missa est: congregation is dismissed

- Mass derived from missa
- In the day, mass was daily
- reenactment of last supper

**High Mass** = Missa solemnis, or full mass

PARTS OF THE MASS

The High Mass

1. Introductory Liturgy of the Word
2. Liturgy of the Eucharist (giving of thanks)

Smaller sections (category of activity)

1. Proper: sections that change from day to day
   - 11 of 17 sections of high mass: Introit, Collects, Epistle, Gradual, Alleluia, Sequence, Gospel, Offertory, Preface, Communion, and Post-Communion respectively
   - texts change on regular basic
2. Ordinary: sections do not change ever
   - 6 of 17 sections: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Its missa est.

**Kyrie** = "Lord have mercy upon us; Christ have mercy upon us."

**Gloria** = "Glory be to God"

**The Credo** = google

**The Sanctus** = "holy, holy, holy"; introduces eucharistic prayer

**Agnus Dei** = Lamb of God

**Ite missa est** = Let us bless the Lord and be dismissed

- since ordinary is repeated, it was chosen to be accompanied by music
- Guillaume de Machaut wrote "The Mass of Notre Dame". This set the ordinary to music
  - First 5 parts of ordinary were set to music
  - Used a plainchant to link all parts. Plainchant was historically the Word of God.

3 species of mass commonalities

1. Constitute settings of ordinary of mass
2. Soprano, alto, tenor, bass (4 parts)
3. Employ triadic harmonic constructs

3 species

1. Cantus firmus mass (fixed melody)
   - used plainchants, which are modal and tenor
   - least complex
2. Paraphrase mass
   - Josphin des Prez wrote these. Eg. Ave maris stella. Agnus Dei No 3 beautiful especially :)
   - turns plainchant from modal into tonal, and becomes subliminal
3. Imitation mass
   - Based on preexisting melody; not plainchant but any melody
   - Protestent Reformation ended this

Protestent Reformation

- Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to church

Impact on mass = **Counter Reformation**

- Council of Trent (1545-1563)
  - Think tank that came together to problem solve what went wrong
  - Ended imitation mass, complex polyphony (need to understand words), instruments in church, and attitude of singers

> The "Canon on music to be used in the mass" - council of trent, illustrated many problems in church music

- **Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina** (1525-1594) = "saviour of Catholic church music"
  - Composed 6 part polyphonic mass, which was accepted by the council of trent
    - Each syllable is heard by itself, such that while there are several voices, each word is heard in a single voice
  - Wrote 104 masses. Eg. Pope Marcellus Mass

## Lecture 6 - The Madrigal

**Madrigal** = a secular, unaccompanied vocal work for four to six individual voices

- Not choral compositions
- Madrigal was most important genre of Italian secular music in 16th century
- Because of Madrigal, Italy became center of European music
- Contained poetry
- Free mix of polyphonic and monophonic parts
- Became increasingly bound up with finding a way to express the literary meaning of a poem
- Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374) was great Italian poet of 13th century
- Pietro Bembo (1470-1547) was poet, statesman, and a cardinal. He was a Petrarch fanatic, and popularized Petrarch's poetry.
- Cipriano de Rore (1516-1565), from Flanders, wrote "Datemi pace o duri miei pensieri", is based on a sonnet by Francesco Petrarch, who's heart betrayed him.
  - Projects mood of sonnet
  - Repeats literal words of sonnet
  - Last line of magrigal treated epigrammatically

> Example of word painting as jarring line suggests jarred heart

- Modern artists must balance modernality and coherence
- Carlo Gesualdo was a wealthy amateur who was talented, and didn't have to work for a patron. This gave him more creative freedom. Eg. "Io parto"
- The Triumph of Oriana, by Thomas Morley, contains many English Madrigals. Eg. "As Vesta Was from Latmos Hill Descending" by Thomas Wilkes

## Lecture 7 - Introduction to the Baroque Era (1600-1750)

**Opera** = stage drama set to music

**Johann Sebastian Bach** (1685-1750)

**Baroque** (barocca): pearl of irregular shape or colour

- Derogatory term for art that was considered overly extravagant (18th century definition)
- By the 1920s, this definition remained in similar meaning but instead with a positive tonality. It shifted to flamboyant, extravagant, and highly detailwd art/music between 1600-1750

**Baroque Era** = time of increasing secularism and scientific discovery

- Galileio's era
- John Kepler discovered formulas on orbit of planets
- Microorganisms
- Blood circulatoin
- Isaac Newton's time
  - Newton believed God is a watchmaker, and the cosmos were God's watch. Believed in God and Science
- The Baroque belief that logical systems (invisible hand of God) rationally controlled the complexity of the World manifested itself in art that celebrated detail controlled by symmetry
- Baroque design about ornament and embellishment. However, it is never chaotic or confused. The era was defined by symmetry, rationality, order and logic controlling detail.
- It was so orderly that they would have hated Swiss Alps or Niagara Falls, since they were not so controlled or orderly.

**Baroque Music** = expressive exuberance and surface extravagance, carefully tempered and controlled by rhythm, a systemic approach to harmony, and symmetrical (cyclical) music forms

|**Religious Topic**|Renaissance (Agnus Dei)|Baroque (Hosanna)|
|----|----|----|
|**Nature of religiousity**|Sober prayer|Extravagant celebration|

|**Secular Topic**|Renaissance (As Vesta Was from Latmos)|Baroque (Dido's Lament)|
|----|----|----|
|**What exactly is being expressed?**|Word-painting. Madrigal is all about words|Opera all about individual emotions|
|**Emotional Impact**|Generic|Individual emotions|

Madrigal vs. Opera

- Not just about __Word Painting__ and __Emotional Expression__; more profoundly, it is also about difference between group expression and individual expression
- Opera development lead to rise of individual in Western culture. Thus, it has had the most important ramifications in the last 400 years

Magnificence and Absoluteism in Baroque Music

- Extraordinary architecture commissioned by kings to rival that made for God
- Louis 14 is greatest example of this

### The French Overture

**Overture** = instrumental word that precedes a stage work

- French Overture is royal version, very magnificent that could welcome a king
- Louis commissioned Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687)
  - Based on Lully's famous style, George Frederick Handel (1685-1759) started his Messiah as a French Overture. Eg. Water Music

French Overture Components

Part 1. Characterized by sweeping scales; a slow, plodding tempo; and dotted (long/short) rhythms
Part 2. Characterized by imitative polyphony and fast tempo

## Lecture 8 - Style Features of Baroque-era Music

Big, Bold Statements

1. Baroque Era fascinated with substance and power of individual human emotions
   - infatuation with theater and invention of opera. Shakespeare from this timeperiod
2. Emotional and expressive exuberance in Baroque-era music that sets it apart from the more restrained and sober music of the Renaissance
3. Era of great scientific investigation and codification
   - Emphasis on logic and control
   - Epressive exuberance tempered by intellectual control
4. Decreasing political power of church of the Church gave rise to the absolute monarch, who claimed to govern through divine right
5. Rise of genuine instrumental musical tradition during the Baroque illustrates that the syntactical elements of Baroque-era music had became substantial enough that they could, by themselves, create viable musical statement without the need of voices

Instrumental Music = most abstract art yet to humankind

- in drawing or painting, physical object exists in at least 2 dimensions
- sculpture exists in 3 dimensions
- poetry, drama, and literature written in language that we can know and recognize
- Instrumental music is great because it has no words, no literary information beyond its title to explain why it exists and why it sounds the way it does

Basics

**Music** = sound in time, or time defined by sound

- Time: some aspect of rhythm
- Sound: pitches -> motives -> melodies -> texture

**Pitch** = discrete sound, a sound we can sing. It has 2 properties: a single fundamental frequency (what makes an A an A) and timbre, or tone color or overtone (what makes an A on a piano differ from that on a saxophone)

- Note = pitch with duration

**Motive** = a brief succession of notes from which melody grows, through the processes of repetition, sequence, and transformation

- Problem = early composers of instrumental music needed a way to create melodic coherence and logic, a way to create melodies that made abstract sense, unto themselves, in absence of words.
- Baroque great age of sequence

**Melody** = any succession of notes

- Tune: special sort of melody, with a clear beginning, middle and end, and with a property called lyricism
- Lyricism: being songlike for a voice
- Lyric melody: conceived vocally
- Theme: principal musical idea in a given section of music
- Conjunct: pitches are relatively close together
- Disjunct: pitches are scattered apart

**Texture** = refers to the number of melodies and the relationship between those melodies in a given segment of music

- Monophony, monophonic texture: single unnaccompanied melody line
- Polyphony (synonymous to counterpoint and contrapuntal): two or more principal melodic parts, each of equal importance
  - Contrapuntal: against point; or note against note.
  - Imitivate Polyphopnic texture: constituent melodic parts sing/play more-or-less the same melody, but staggered at various time intervals, so that the melody overlaps with itself
    - Strict: each constituent part imitates the other parts exactly. Eg. row row row your boat. Canon or Round
    - Non-strict: voices imitate each other, but not exactly. Therefore, no cyclical groove. Eg. Agnus Dei No. 3, josquin dez pres
  - Non-imitative polyphony: 2 or more simultaneous melodies and different melodies; neither are more important than the other
- Homophony, homophonic texture: one in which one melody is predominant and all other melodic or harmonic material is perceived as being accompanimental

> In the Renaissance, instrumental music was also created as suites: collection of dances

- Instrument design exploded in the Baroque
- Piano invented.. harpsicord mastered
- Flute, oboe, trombone, and violin family came into existence
- Tuning systems (well-tempered) came into existance
- meter (grouping of notes) standardized, as well as bar lines
- Functional harmony came into existence

## Lecture 9 - National Styles Italy and Germany

**Cavatina**: type of aria

- Gioacchino Rossini: THe Barber of Seville (1816)
  - Purpose of this cavatina is to identify Rossina as a saucy, smart and determined young lady and to entertain the audience
- Beethoven: Symphony No. 5 in C-, Movement 1 (1808)
  - Meaning is to be expressed and understood by individual experiences

Italian Quote

> *Music for the Italians is a sensual pleasure and nothing more. Fore this noble expression of the mind, they have hardly more respect than for cooking! They want a score that, like a plate of macaroni, can be assimilated immediately without their having to think about it or even pay attention to it* - Hector Berlioz

German Quote

> *What instrumental work of Beethoven testifies to his art and genius to a higher degree than the immeasurably noble and profound Symphony in C Minor? How this marvelous composition carries the hearer irresistibly with it in its ever-mounting climax into the spirit kingdom of the infinite! What could be simpler than the main motive of the first movement composed of a mere rhythmic figure which, beginning in unison, does not even indicate the key to the listener. The character of anxious, restless longing this passage carries with it only brings out more clearly the melodiousness of the second theme. It appears as if the breast, burned and oppressed by the premonition of tragedy, of threatening annihilation, in gasping tones was struggling with all its strength for air* - E.T.A. Hoffmann

As discovered by these quotes,

- Rossini's cavatina personified the 19th-centure Italian view that 'music = opera' and that opera is a form of entertainment
- Beethoven's symphonic music personifies the German/Austrian view of music as something profound and capable of the deepest metaphorical expression
- Italians great for melody, germans great for harmony

**Nationalism**: the use of folk or ethnic music in concert compositions

- While Beethoven appreciated Rossini's music, he didn't compose the like because it wasn't culturally appropriate
- National styles have to do with language and culture in which composer grew up. This changes how composers perceive their music

Vocal music originated as latin music in Church

> The nature of the language set to music will determine the nature of the melody that results

Vocal music persisted from this and was most developed in Italy for 2 reasons

1. Nature of Italian language (closest to latin)
2. Christian church based in Rome

### Italian Baroque Style

Due to the Madrigal, Italian language replaced Latin as dominant language in vocal music

The style was characterised by:

1. It was an outgrowth of Latin vocalism and the equally vocal character of the Italian language
2. It was essentially a homophonic tradition: melody and accompaniment, the perfect example of which is opera, the dominant art form of the era
3. Exhibited a preference for melodic directness, as opposed to the ornamental complexity of the French style and the polyphonic and harmonic complexity of the Baroque German Style
4. Italian Baroque Opera gave birth to the 2 most important orchestral genres of the next 400 years = symphony and concerto

Italian and Latin are considered **melismatic languages** that, by nature, beg for long, soaring [melismas](#high-middle-ages) when set to music. In contrast, English and German are syllabic languages that prefer one pitch per syllable when being set to music; languages that allow for only occasional melisma.

### Affect of Protestantism on German Style

In 1517, Martin Luther posted 95 Theses

- This lead to counterroman revolution and wars between 1548-1648, including the Thirty Years War (1615-1648)
- This was ended by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648

**Protestantism** stayed after the battle

**Lutheranism** profoundly affected music. It included:

- Papacy rejected, as was supernatural character of priesthood
- Called clergy ministers, not priests and allowed them to marry
- Rejected confessional and priestly absolution
- Abandoned saying of masses and prayers for the dead
- Gave up cults of saints and Virgin Mary
- Declared that the one true source ofChristian belief was the Bible
- Vernacular language replaced Latin in the Church

This change in language lead to the adoption of German-language songs (hymns) to replace Latin plainchant

- hymns (or chorales) became backbones of music across Lutheran communities across Europe

> *After theology, I give music the greatest educational importance and highest honour* - Martin Luther

- this vision of music as close to theology was instrumental in development of Bach and others. Since Luther thought music was a gift of God, music was considered a godly act
- Contrastingly to Catholics who emphasised vocal music, Lutheran communities thought instrumental music could also be used to equally worship God

When enjoying music, if we feel a rush of connection to it, it can be seen in 2 different lights

1. Personification of hedonism. We are self-indulging
2. We leave our egos behind and are susceptible to divine influence

Luther thought that music that made us more susceptible to God was beautiful and promoted it such that it grew far more than in Italian, Catholic communities

### German Baroque Style

Syllabic music demonstrated by "Awake! Now Strikes the Hour" - Bach Cantata no. 140

- setting is one pitch per syllable
- sharp articulations reflectin in sharp, articulated rhythms of the melody
- sharply articulated, compact language creates a sharply articulated, compact tune

Lutheran Church Hymn: staple across Germany

Bach created all his music for God as a Lutheran. He not only dedicated his spiritual works, but also his secular works to God. He inscribed them as INJ (in the name of Jesus). Bach made his compositional technique and spirituality intertwined. His native German language and Lutheran faith that were the cornerstone of his worldview AND the sound of his music.
