# Structural Materials and Corrosion

## Concrete

### Concrete Classification

#### Type Classification

- Unreinforced (regular concrete)
- Reinforced (regular w/ rebar)
- Prestressed (w/ tensioned wire strands)

#### Production

- Ready-mix (small projects)
- Cast-in-place (transported to site and poured)
- Precast (premade pieces)

#### Strength/Density

- Low (<20 MPa)/(240-1800 kg/m^3)
- Normal (20-60 MPa)/(2150-2500 kg/m^3)
- High (>60 MPa)/(6400 kg/m^3)

#### Special

- Self-consolidating
  - Flows well
  - Resists segregation
- High-performance
  - Workable, strong, low w/c ratio, has superplasticizer
- Fibre-reinforced
  - Small metal-fibres close cracks
  - Higher tensile strength
  - Ductile and stiff
  - Fatigue resistant
