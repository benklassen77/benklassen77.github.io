# Structural Materials and Corrosion

## Concrete

### Concrete Classification

#### Type Classification

- Unreinforced (regular concrete)
- Reinforced (regular w/ rebar)
- Prestressed (w/ tensioned wire strands)

#### Production

- Ready-mix (small projects)
- Cast-in-place (transported to site and poured)
- Precast (premade pieces)

#### Strength/Density

- Low (<20 MPa)/(240-1800 kg/m^3)
- Normal (20-60 MPa)/(2150-2500 kg/m^3)
- High (>60 MPa)/(6400 kg/m^3)

#### Special

- Self-consolidating
  - Flows well
  - Resists segregation
- High-performance
  - Workable, strong, low w/c ratio, has superplasticizer
- Fibre-reinforced
  - Small metal-fibres close cracks
  - Higher tensile strength
  - Ductile and stiff
  - Fatigue resistant

### Properties of Cured Concrete

#### Strength

The Strength is dependent on the following

- w/c ratio. Lower ratio typically means stronger
- Aggregate strength
- Aggregate-cementous bond
- Moisture and temperature during curing
- Age of concrete (gains strength over time)
- Rate of loading when tested

Concrete is designed based on the f'c. This is the compressive strength of the concrete 28 days after being poured. The tensile strength is assumed to be zero when it is designed.

- Between 30-40% of the f'c, the behaviour is linear
- Between 40-50% of the f'c, bond cracks form
- Between 50-75% of the f'c, mortar cracks form
- Between 75-100% of the f'c, continuous cracks form until failure

To calculate the compressive strength, use the following equations

$$E_c=4500\sqrt{f\prime_c}\tag{Simplified}$$

$$E_c=(3300\sqrt{f\prime_c}+6900)(\frac{\gamma_c}{2300})^1.5\tag{General}$$
