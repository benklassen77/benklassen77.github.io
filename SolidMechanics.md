Prodedure

1. Check for points where slope or deflection is known
2. Solve for reactions at supports
3. Take a cut any distance x from a reaction and find Mo equation
4. Integrate equations according to the following equation

$$EI\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=M(x)\tag{Moment Equation}$$
$$EI\sigma(x) = \int_0^x M(x)dx + C\tag{Slope Equation}$$
$$EIy(x)=\iint{M(x)dx+C_1} + C_2\tag{Deflection Equation}$$
