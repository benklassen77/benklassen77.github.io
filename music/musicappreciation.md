## Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror

- We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.

4 Assumptions of music as a mirror

1. For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change
2. Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music
3. As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes
4. As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music

- disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy
- Classical = 1750 - 1827.

## Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church

**Ancient World** = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]

- Only 40ish pieces survived
- Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes
- Greece music was humanistic
  - Contained the doctrine of ethos
  - Based on pythagorus's theorum on music

- Music is not like math

600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.

**Principles of Music in Early Church** = 3 things

1. Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\
2. Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.
3. Large choruses, "bright" melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.

- Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).
- Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music

## Lecture 3: Middle Ages

Middle Ages: 600 AD - 1400 AD

- Dark Ages: 600-1000
- High Middle Ages: 1000-1400

### Dark Ages

Music in Early Medieval Church

1. Created mood conducive to long hours of prayerful contemplation
2. Embellished formal services

- Viewed music as a tool of ceremony and ritual
- Dance music with beat was frowned upon because reminded us of our sexuality

**Plainchant** = unadorned and unaccompanied, single unaccompanied melody line called a monophony (one sound)

- commonly refered to as gregorian chant due to Pope Gregory's time
- plainchant hymn = straightforward, memorable, compact melody, melody repeated with each new text stanza
  - sung during the hours, but never at church
    - **Matins**: held before dawn
    - **Lauds**: held at daybreak
    - **Vespers**: held at sunset
- monotone plainchant = sung on a single pitch

**Monophonic texture** = single, unaccompanied melody line

### High Middle Ages

- technologies like farming came back to Europe
- Christianity brought back civility and culture
- Universities founded
- Specialties occured with cities
- Architecture improved
  - Canterbury Cathedral (1070)
  - Notre Dame (1163)
  - Chartres Cathedral (1223)
  - Cologne (12478)
- Dante etc.
- Crusades occurred

**Polyphony** = musical texture in which there are 2 or more musical melodies heard simultaneously

- composer and notation started. This lead to music with ego, and named works
  - lead to modern view of music as self-expressive / egocentric

**Organum** = 2-part polyphonic composition, with plainchant and Word of God, is present in one voice and the hand of man (decorative voice) celebrates and elaborateas the word of God.

- Tenore = lower sustained voice
- Duplum = decorative voice

**Florid organum** = flowery organum from 1150-1300. Much was composed in Notre Dame

- group of composers in florid called ars antiqua
  - 2 composers leonin and perotin

**Melisma** = single syllable is sung over multiple changing pitches

1. Between 1305-1378, Babylonian Captivity took place. Pope took over land. After this, Great Schism occurred with doubts of faith.
2. Black Death 1347-1350
3. Hundred Years War 1338-1453

- Created swing towards secular art and liturature.
  - Divine Comedy (Dants), Canterbury Tales (Chaucer), Decameron (Boccaccio)

Ars nova: the new art. This is 14th century music

- secular
- extraordinary, polyphonic complexity. **Isorhythm** = 2 basic aspects of music melody and rhythm could be isolated
- art became more humanistic again
