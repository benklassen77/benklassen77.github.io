## Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror

- We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.

4 Assumptions of music as a mirror

1. For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change
2. Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music
3. As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes
4. As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music

- disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy
