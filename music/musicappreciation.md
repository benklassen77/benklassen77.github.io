## Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror

- We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.

4 Assumptions of music as a mirror

1. For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change
2. Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music
3. As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes
4. As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music

- disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy
- Classical = 1750 - 1827.

## Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church

**Ancient World** = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]

- Only 40ish pieces survived
- Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes
- Greece music was humanistic
  - Contained the doctrine of ethos
  - Based on pythagorus's theorum on music

- Music is not like math

600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.

**Principles of Music in Early Church** = 3 things

1. Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\
2. Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.
3. Large choruses, "bright" melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.

- Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).
- Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music
