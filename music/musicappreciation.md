## Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror

- We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.

4 Assumptions of music as a mirror

1. For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change
2. Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music
3. As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes
4. As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music

- disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy
- Classical = 1750 - 1827.

## Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church

**Ancient World** = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]

- Only 40ish pieces survived
- Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes
- Greece music was humanistic
  - Contained the doctrine of ethos
  - Based on pythagorus's theorum on music

- Music is not like math

600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.

**Principles of Music in Early Church** = 3 things

1. Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\
2. Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.
3. Large choruses, "bright" melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.

- Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).
- Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music

## Lecture 3: Middle Ages

Middle Ages: 600 AD - 1400 AD

- Dark Ages: 600-1000
- High Middle Ages: 1000-1400

### Dark Ages

Music in Early Medieval Church

1. Created mood conducive to long hours of prayerful contemplation
2. Embellished formal services

- Viewed music as a tool of ceremony and ritual
- Dance music with beat was frowned upon because reminded us of our sexuality

**Plainchant** = unadorned and unaccompanied, single unaccompanied melody line called a monophony (one sound)

- commonly refered to as gregorian chant due to Pope Gregory's time
- plainchant hymn = straightforward, memorable, compact melody, melody repeated with each new text stanza
  - sung during the hours, but never at church
    - **Matins**: held before dawn
    - **Lauds**: held at daybreak
    - **Vespers**: held at sunset
- monotone plainchant = sung on a single pitch

**Monophonic texture** = single, unaccompanied melody line

### High Middle Ages

- technologies like farming came back to Europe
- Christianity brought back civility and culture
- Universities founded
- Specialties occured with cities
- Architecture improved
  - Canterbury Cathedral (1070)
  - Notre Dame (1163)
  - Chartres Cathedral (1223)
  - Cologne (12478)
- Dante etc.
- Crusades occurred

**Polyphony** = musical texture in which there are 2 or more musical melodies heard simultaneously

- composer and notation started. This lead to music with ego, and named works
  - lead to modern view of music as self-expressive / egocentric

**Organum** = 2-part polyphonic composition, with plainchant and Word of God, is present in one voice and the hand of man (decorative voice) celebrates and elaborateas the word of God.

- Tenore = lower sustained voice
- Duplum = decorative voice

**Florid organum** = flowery organum from 1150-1300. Much was composed in Notre Dame

- group of composers in florid called ars antiqua
  - 2 composers leonin and perotin

**Melisma** = single syllable is sung over multiple changing pitches

1. Between 1305-1378, Babylonian Captivity took place. Pope took over land. After this, Great Schism occurred with doubts of faith.
2. Black Death 1347-1350
3. Hundred Years War 1338-1453

- Created swing towards secular art and liturature.
  - Divine Comedy (Dants), Canterbury Tales (Chaucer), Decameron (Boccaccio)

Ars nova: the new art. This is 14th century music

- secular
- extraordinary, polyphonic complexity. **Isorhythm** = 2 basic aspects of music melody and rhythm could be isolated
  - One isorhythmic composer Guillaume de Machaut. Eg. Quant en moy (1350)
- art became more humanistic again

## Lecture 4 - Intro to the Renaissance

2 rules of thought that explain shift from God-serving to egocentric society

1. MEDIEVAL THOUGHT: credo ut intelligam: understanding can only come through belief
2. 15th CENTURY THOUGHT: intelligo ut credam: belief can only come through understanding

Reneissance Events

- classicism: language, literature, philosophy, art, architecture etc.

> "At the core of ancient greek and roman writings {rhetoric, education, poetry, morals philosophy}, the central figure was not Christ; not the transient, 'worthless' figure of humankind as described by mediaval theologians, but man - independent, intelligent, adventurous, and capable" - Burke

- lead to humanism movement, with emphasis on human accomplishments
- 95 thesis - Martin Luther
- Education: secular education. Highered scholars instead of church
- Printing press (1450)
- Art (botticelli, da vince, rafael)

Renaissance Music

- Clear articulation of the words
  - Music cannot be overly mellismatic (eg. Leonin). This was obsolete by 15th century
- Concept that music should reflect and intensify the meaning of the words (word-painting)

**Consonant**: blend well

**Dissonant**: do not blend well

- The more complex the ratios are, the more dissonant

**Homophonic Texture**: Foreground (melody), middle ground (baseline) and background (inner voices)

- Josquin des Prez is a very highly respected musician of the Renaissance
  - **High Renaissance Style**: Fluid, lacking sharp rhythmic edge generally, smooth, conjunct, controlled polyphony, occasional homophony
  - Petite Camusette is an example of **imitative polyphony**: parts imitate each other here and there (1500)

- Giovanni del Palestrina was other great

|Quant en moy|Petite Camusette|
|----|----|
|Foreign, spiky, isorhythmic|Clear, conjunct, clear, homogenous|
|French love song| French love song|

**A capella** = as in chapel

Because of the printing press, Josquin's followers could learn his music faster, as well as ensure further change in musical styles.

Great Renaissance Polyphonists Shortlist

- Johannes Ockeghem
- Guillaume dufay
- Jacob Obrecht
- Heinrich Isaac
- Jean Mouton
- Jacob Arcadelt
- Orlando Lassus

## Lecture 5 - Renaissance Mass

Mass as religious ceremony

Ite missa est: congregation is dismissed

- Mass derived from missa
- In the day, mass was daily
- reenactment of last supper

**High Mass** = Missa solemnis, or full mass

PARTS OF THE MASS

The High Mass

1. Introductory Liturgy of the Word
2. Liturgy of the Eucharist (giving of thanks)

Smaller sections (category of activity)

1. Proper: sections that change from day to day
   - 11 of 17 sections of high mass: Introit, Collects, Epistle, Gradual, Alleluia, Sequence, Gospel, Offertory, Preface, Communion, and Post-Communion respectively
   - texts change on regular basic
2. Ordinary: sections do not change ever
   - 6 of 17 sections: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Its missa est.

**Kyrie** = "Lord have mercy upon us; Christ have mercy upon us."

**Gloria** = "Glory be to God"

**The Credo** = google

**The Sanctus** = "holy, holy, holy"; introduces eucharistic prayer

**Agnus Dei** = Lamb of God

**Ite missa est** = Let us bless the Lord and be dismissed

- since ordinary is repeated, it was chosen to be accompanied by music
- Guillaume de Machaut wrote "The Mass of Notre Dame". This set the ordinary to music
  - First 5 parts of ordinary were set to music
  - Used a plainchant to link all parts. Plainchant was historically the Word of God.

3 species of mass commonalities

1. Constitute settings of ordinary of mass
2. Soprano, alto, tenor, bass (4 parts)
3. Employ triadic harmonic constructs

3 species

1. Cantus firmus mass (fixed melody)
   - used plainchants, which are modal and tenor
   - least complex
2. Paraphrase mass
   - Josphin des Prez wrote these. Eg. Ave maris stella. Agnus Dei No 3 beautiful especially :)
   - turns plainchant from modal into tonal, and becomes subliminal
3. Imitation mass
   - Based on preexisting melody; not plainchant but any melody
   - Protestent Reformation ended this

Protestent Reformation

- Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to church

Impact on mass = **Counter Reformation**

- Council of Trent (1545-1563)
  - Think tank that came together to problem solve what went wrong
  - Ended imitation mass, complex polyphony (need to understand words), instruments in church, and attitude of singers

> The "Canon on music to be used in the mass" - council of trent, illustrated many problems in church music

- **Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina** (1525-1594) = "saviour of Catholic church music"
  - Composed 6 part polyphonic mass, which was accepted by the council of trent
    - Each syllable is heard by itself, such that while there are several voices, each word is heard in a single voice
  - Wrote 104 masses. Eg. Pope Marcellus Mass

## Lecture 6 - The Madrigal

**Madrigal** = a secular, unaccompanied vocal work for four to six individual voices

- Not choral compositions
- Madrigal was most important genre of Italian secular music in 16th century
- Because of Madrigal, Italy became center of European music
- Contained poetry
- Free mix of polyphonic and monophonic parts
- Became increasingly bound up with finding a way to express the literary meaning of a poem
- Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374) was great Italian poet of 13th century
- Pietro Bembo (1470-1547) was poet, statesman, and a cardinal. He was a Petrarch fanatic, and popularized Petrarch's poetry.
- Cipriano de Rore (1516-1565), from Flanders, wrote "Datemi pace o duri miei pensieri", is based on a sonnet by Francesco Petrarch, who's heart betrayed him.
  - Projects mood of sonnet
  - Repeats literal words of sonnet
  - Last line of magrigal treated epigrammatically

> Example of word painting as jarring line suggests jarred heart

- Modern artists must balance modernality and coherence
- Carlo Gesualdo was a wealthy amateur who was talented, and didn't have to work for a patron. This gave him more creative freedom. Eg. "Io parto"
- The Triumph of Oriana, by Thomas Morley, contains many English Madrigals. Eg. "As Vesta Was from Latmos Hill Descending" by Thomas Wilkes
