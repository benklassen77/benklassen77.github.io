<ol>
<li>For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change</li>
<li>Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music</li>
<li>As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes</li>
<li>As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy</li>
<li>Classical = 1750 - 1827.</li>

<li>Large choruses, &quot;bright&quot; melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.</li>
