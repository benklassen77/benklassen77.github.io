<ul>
<li>We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.</li>
</ul>
<p>4 Assumptions of music as a mirror</p>
<ol>
<li>For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change</li>
<li>Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music</li>
<li>As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes</li>
<li>As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy</li>
<li>Classical = 1750 - 1827.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-2---ancient-times-and-early-church">Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church</h2>
<p><strong>Ancient World</strong> = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only 40ish pieces survived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greece music was humanistic</p>
<ul>
<li>Contained the doctrine of ethos</li>
<li>Based on pythagorus's theorum on music</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music is not like math</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Music in Early Church</strong> = 3 things</p>
<ol>
<li>Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\</li>
<li>Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.</li>
<li>Large choruses, &quot;bright&quot; melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).</li>
<li>Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music</li>
</ul>
