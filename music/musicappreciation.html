<h2 id="lecture-1---music-as-a-mirror">Lecture 1 - Music As A Mirror</h2>
<ul>
<li>We like to idealize composers as virtuosous, but in reality many composed for money.</li>
</ul>
<p>4 Assumptions of music as a mirror</p>
<ol>
<li>For the last millenium, Western music has experienced stylistic change</li>
<li>Result of deleloping concept of composer, who's ego affects the music</li>
<li>As time changes, what should be expressed in music changes</li>
<li>As rate of change increases in society, so does rate of change in Western music</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>disjunct melody: notes relatively far from each other. Jaggedy</li>
<li>Classical = 1750 - 1827.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-2---ancient-times-and-early-church">Lecture 2 - Ancient Times and Early Church</h2>
<p><strong>Ancient World</strong> = 3500 BC [Sumerian Civilization] to 500 AD [disintegration of roman numicipal authority in western europe]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only 40ish pieces survived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike science, medicine etc., music doesn't improve with time. It changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greece music was humanistic</p>
<ul>
<li>Contained the doctrine of ethos</li>
<li>Based on pythagorus's theorum on music</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music is not like math</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>600-1400 (Middle Ages) = Theocratic Age.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Music in Early Church</strong> = 3 things</p>
<ol>
<li>Music is only usefil if it reminds us of divine or perfect beauty. If it is self-centred beauty, egocentric, or hedonistic, it is rejected. If it is divine and prayerful, it is accepted.\</li>
<li>Music is servant to religion. Since it must be vocal, instrumental not okay.</li>
<li>Large choruses, &quot;bright&quot; melodies and dancing rejected for promoting licentious pagan festivals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Because of these rules, early churches survived dark ages (first 400 years of middle ages).</li>
<li>Greek humanistic view was replaced by churches ceremonial and religious view of music</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-3-middle-ages">Lecture 3: Middle Ages</h2>
<p>Middle Ages: 600 AD - 1400 AD</p>
<ul>

<li>Embellished formal services</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Viewed music as a tool of ceremony and ritual</li>
<li>Dance music with beat was frowned upon because reminded us of our sexuality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plainchant</strong> = unadorned and unaccompanied, single unaccompanied melody line called a monophony (one sound)</p>
<ul>
<li>commonly refered to as gregorian chant due to Pope Gregory's time</li>

<ul>
<li>lead to modern view of music as self-expressive / egocentric</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organum</strong> = 2-part polyphonic composition, with plainchant and Word of God, is present in one voice and the hand of man (decorative voice) celebrates and elaborateas the word of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tenore = lower sustained voice</li>
<li>Duplum = decorative voice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Florid organum</strong> = flowery organum from 1150-1300. Much was composed in Notre Dame</p>

<li>secular</li>
<li>extraordinary, polyphonic complexity. <strong>Isorhythm</strong> = 2 basic aspects of music melody and rhythm could be isolated
<ul>
<li>One isorhythmic composer Guillaume de Machaut. Eg. Quant en moy (1350)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>art became more humanistic again</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-4---intro-to-the-renaissance">Lecture 4 - Intro to the Renaissance</h2>
<p>2 rules of thought that explain shift from God-serving to egocentric society</p>
<ol>
<li>MEDIEVAL THOUGHT: credo ut intelligam: understanding can only come through belief</li>
<li>15th CENTURY THOUGHT: intelligo ut credam: belief can only come through understanding</li>
</ol>
<p>Reneissance Events</p>
<ul>
<li>classicism: language, literature, philosophy, art, architecture etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At the core of ancient greek and roman writings {rhetoric, education, poetry, morals philosophy}, the central figure was not Christ; not the transient, 'worthless' figure of humankind as described by mediaval theologians, but man - independent, intelligent, adventurous, and capable&quot; - Burke</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>lead to humanism movement, with emphasis on human accomplishments</li>
<li>95 thesis - Martin Luther</li>
<li>Education: secular education. Highered scholars instead of church</li>
<li>Printing press (1450)</li>
<li>Art (botticelli, da vince, rafael)</li>
</ul>
<p>Renaissance Music</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear articulation of the words
<ul>
<li>Music cannot be overly mellismatic (eg. Leonin). This was obsolete by 15th century</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concept that music should reflect and intensify the meaning of the words (word-painting)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consonant</strong>: blend well</p>
<p><strong>Dissonant</strong>: do not blend well</p>
<ul>
<li>The more complex the ratios are, the more dissonant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Homophonic Texture</strong>: Foreground (melody), middle ground (baseline) and background (inner voices)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Josquin des Prez is a very highly respected musician of the Renaissance</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Renaissance Style</strong>: Fluid, lacking sharp rhythmic edge generally, smooth, conjunct, controlled polyphony, occasional homophony</li>
<li>Petite Camusette is an example of <strong>imitative polyphony</strong>: parts imitate each other here and there (1500)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Giovanni del Palestrina was other great</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A capella</strong> = as in chapel</p>
<p>Because of the printing press, Josquin's followers could learn his music faster, as well as ensure further change in musical styles.</p>

<h2 id="renaissance-mass">Renaissance Mass</h2>
<p>Mass as religious ceremony</p>
<p>Ite missa est: congregation is dismissed</p>
<ul>
<li>Mass derived from missa</li>
<li>In the day, mass was daily</li>
<li>reenactment of last supper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High Mass</strong> = Missa solemnis, or full mass</p>
<p>PARTS OF THE MASS</p>
<p>The High Mass</p>
<ol>
<li>Introductory Liturgy of the Word</li>
<li>Liturgy of the Eucharist (giving of thanks)</li>
</ol>
<p>Smaller sections (category of activity)</p>
<ol>
<li>Proper: sections that change from day to day
<ul>
<li>11 of 17 sections of high mass: Introit, Collects, Epistle, Gradual, Alleluia, Sequence, Gospel, Offertory, Preface, Communion, and Post-Communion respectively</li>
<li>texts change on regular basic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ordinary: sections do not change ever
<ul>
<li>6 of 17 sections: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Its missa est.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Kyrie</strong> = &quot;Lord have mercy upon us; Christ have mercy upon us.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Gloria</strong> = &quot;Glory be to God&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The Credo</strong> = google</p>
<p><strong>The Sanctus</strong> = &quot;holy, holy, holy&quot;; introduces eucharistic prayer</p>
<p><strong>Agnus Dei</strong> = Lamb of God</p>
<p><strong>Ite missa est</strong> = Let us bless the Lord and be dismissed</p>
<ul>
<li>since ordinary is repeated, it was chosen to be accompanied by music</li>
<li>Guillaume de Machaut wrote &quot;The Mass of Notre Dame&quot;. This set the ordinary to music
<ul>
<li>First 5 parts of ordinary were set to music</li>
<li>Used a plainchant to link all parts. Plainchant was historically the Word of God.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3 species of mass commonalities</p>
<ol>
<li>Constitute settings of ordinary of mass</li>
<li>Soprano, alto, tenor, bass (4 parts)</li>
<li>Employ triadic harmonic constructs</li>
</ol>
<p>3 species</p>
<ol>
<li>Cantus firmus mass (fixed melody)
<ul>
<li>used plainchants, which are modal and tenor</li>
<li>least complex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paraphrase mass
<ul>
<li>Josphin des Prez wrote these. Eg. Ave maris stella. Agnus Dei No 3 beautiful especially :)</li>
<li>turns plainchant from modal into tonal, and becomes subliminal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Imitation mass
<ul>
<li>Based on preexisting melody; not plainchant but any melody</li>
<li>Protestent Reformation ended this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Protestent Reformation</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to church</li>
</ul>
<p>Impact on mass = <strong>Counter Reformation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Council of Trent (1545-1563)
<ul>
<li>Think tank that came together to problem solve what went wrong</li>
<li>Ended imitation mass, complex polyphony (need to understand words), instruments in church, and attitude of singers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Canon on music to be used in the mass&quot; - council of trent, illustrated many problems in church music</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</strong> (1525-1594) = &quot;saviour of Catholic church music&quot;
<ul>
<li>Composed 6 part polyphonic mass, which was accepted by the council of trent
<ul>
<li>Each syllable is heard by itself, such that while there are several voices, each word is heard in a single voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrote 104 masses. Eg. Pope Marcellus Mass</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
